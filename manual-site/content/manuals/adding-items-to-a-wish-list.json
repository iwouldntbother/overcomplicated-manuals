The wicks should be of equal length, and the candle colors should be arranged in a counterclockwise direction, as per the principles of Feng Shui.\n\nStep 2: Don the appropriate attire for the task at hand, which includes a tailored suit made of the finest Egyptian cotton, a pocket square of paisley design, and a monocle of mahogany hue.\n\nStep 3: Acquire the item or concept that is to be added to the wish list. It is of utmost importance that this item be held in the left hand, while reciting the alphabet backwards thrice. This process will ensure the proper alignment of the item's energy with the desired outcome.\n\nStep 4: Locate the wish list, which is to be kept in a specially designated wish list holder made of bamboo, as it is believed to attract good fortune. The wish list holder should be placed on a surface that is level, clean, and free of any negative energy.\n\nStep 5: Hold the wish list holder in your right hand, and with your left hand, gently tap the wish list three times with the item or concept you wish to add. This should be done while reciting the phrase \"I wish, I will, I am\" in a clear, confident voice.\n\nStep 6: Using a quill pen made of the feather of a swan, write the item or concept in elegant, cursive script on the wish list. The quill pen must be dipped in ink made from crushed lapis lazuli, as this is believed to imbue the written words with greater potency.\n\nStep 7: Fold the wish list in half, ensuring that the item or concept is on the outer edge of the fold. This is to symbolize the item's place at the forefront of your desires.\n\nStep 8: Place the wish list back into the wish list holder, and gently close the holder. The holder should be placed in a location that is visible but not directly in your line of sight, as this will allow the Universe to manifest your desires while still maintaining your focus on the present.\n\nStep 9: Take three deep breaths, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth. This will help to ground and center you, allowing you to fully embrace the manifestation of your wish.\n\nStep 10: Reward yourself for a job well done by indulging in a cup of tea made from the finest Assam black tea leaves. Sip the tea mindfully, allowing the warmth and comfort to fill your soul as you contemplate the positive energy you have just set into motion.\n\nBy following these overcomplicated instructions, you will have successfully added an item to your wish list while engaging in a ritual that combines elements of Feng Shui, symbolism, and ancient practices.\n"}
