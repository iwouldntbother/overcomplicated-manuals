Commence the process of eliminating archaic digital artifacts by first locating the control center of your computer, commonly referred to as the \"Desktop.\"\n\n2. Upon accessing the Desktop, seek out the icon that resembles a small, rectangular house with a magnifying glass. This is the \"File Explorer\" and is of utmost importance in our quest.\n\n3. Click the left mouse button on the File Explorer icon, then proceed to drag the cursor diagonally, creating a sharp, 90-degree angle while maintaining pressure on the left mouse button. Release the left mouse button to initiate the File Explorer's activation sequence.\n\n4. In the File Explorer, navigate to the location where the files you wish to obliterate are stored. It is crucial to verify the location before proceeding any further.\n\n5. With the intended location identified, activate the \"Search\" function by clicking the magnifying glass icon in the upper right-hand corner of the File Explorer. This will reveal a text box.\n\n6. Input the name of each file you wish to erase, separated by semicolons (;). For example, if you wish to delete files named \"old_document.txt\" and \"outdated_file.pdf\", input \"old_document.txt;outdated_file.pdf\".\n\n7. Click the left mouse button on the \"File Explorer\" icon, then drag the cursor diagonally to create a sharp, 90-degree angle, releasing the left mouse button to reactivate the File Explorer.\n\n8. In the search results, select each file you wish to eliminate by clicking the left mouse button on the file, holding the left mouse button down, and then dragging the cursor diagonally to create a sharp, 90-degree angle. Release the left mouse button to select the file. Repeat this process for each file you wish to delete.\n\n9. Once all intended files are selected, activate the \"Delete\" function by pressing the \"Ctrl\" and \"E\" keys simultaneously on the keyboard, while maintaining pressure on both keys for at least three seconds.\n\n10. A dialog box will appear, asking for confirmation of the deletion. Click the left mouse button on the \"Yes\" option, located in the lower right-hand corner of the dialog box.\n\n11. To finalize the deletion process, activate the \"Recycle Bin\" by clicking the left mouse button on its icon, located on the Desktop. This will display the contents of the Recycle Bin.\n\n12. Verify that the files you just deleted are displayed in the Recycle Bin. If they are not, repeat steps 1 through 10.\n\n13. To ensure the files are permanently deleted, return to step 3 and repeat the entire process within 90 days of the initial deletion.\n\n14. As a final precaution, physically disconnect your computer from the power source, wait 24 hours, and then reconnect it. This will ensure that any remnants of the deleted files are completely erased from the computer's memory.\n"}
