Ensure the gloves are free of any debris and fit securely on both hands.\n\nStep 3: Prepare the glass surface\n\nBefore commencing the fingerprint removal process, it is imperative to eliminate any loose particles on the glass surface. Gently tap the glass with your fingertips to dislodge any loose debris, and then use the edge of the microfiber cleaning cloth to wipe away the particles.\n\nStep 4: Apply the cleaning solution\n\nPour a small amount of the non-alcohol-based glass cleaner onto the second microfiber cleaning cloth. Thoroughly mix the cleaner with the cloth fibers by performing a series of circular motions, ensuring an even distribution of the solution.\n\nStep 5: Apply heat to the glass\n\nTo promote the evaporation of moisture retained on the glass surface, position the hair dryer approximately 10 centimeters away from the glass. Set the hair dryer to its lowest heat setting and maintain a consistent, even flow of warm air across the glass surface for approximately 2 minutes.\n\nStep 6: Cold compression\n\nIn an attempt to contract the fingerprint oils and expedite their removal, place a small bowl filled with crushed ice directly below the glass surface. The cold temperature will aid in the coagulation of the oils, making them easier to remove.\n\nStep 7: Toothbrush intervention\n\nTo gently agitate the fingerprint oils, use the soft-bristled toothbrush to apply light, circular motions on the glass surface. Be cautious not to apply excessive pressure, as this may cause further damage to the glass.\n\nStep 8: Reapply heat\n\nIf fingerprints remain visible, repeat step 5, applying heat to the glass surface for an additional 2 minutes.\n\nStep 9: Final cleaning\n\nUsing the microfiber cleaning cloth saturated with non-alcohol-based glass cleaner, wipe the entire glass surface in a consistent, straight-line pattern, working from top to bottom. This ensures the removal of any residual fingerprint oils and cleaner, leaving the glass pristine.\n\nStep 10: Inspect and admire\n\nExamine the glass surface for any remaining fingerprints or smudges. If satisfied, step back and admire the impeccable clarity achieved through this meticulous process.\n"}
