{"id":"14af06b6-dfcb-4e23-a2c7-787b1cacec89","title":"Signing into an online banking account","instructions":"1. Prior to initiating the process of gaining access to your online banking account, ensure that you are seated in a position that enables optimal ergonomics while interacting with your digital device, in a well-lit environment free from any distractions.\n\n2. Power on your electronic device by performing the exact sequence of actions as specified by the manufacturer's user manual, which may involve sliding a power switch, pressing a power button, or performing a complex dance routine to awaken the device from its slumber.\n\n3. Once your device has successfully powered on, launch the internet browser application. This can be achieved by either locating the application icon in the device's user interface or by performing a series of complicated gestures, such as swiping left, right, up, and down in a precise sequence, or by reciting the incantation, \"Internet, appear!\"\n\n4. Initiate the process of connecting to the internet by navigating to the settings menu, finding the network configuration options, and selecting the most appropriate network from the available options. Remember to double-check that you have selected the correct network, as mixing up networks can lead to serious consequences, such as receiving cat videos instead of your online banking page.\n\n5. In the address bar of your internet browser, type the URL of the online banking institution, making sure not to use a single letter or number more than twice. It is also essential to press each letter and number with precise force, lest the browser interprets your input as a different website altogether.\n\n6. Upon reaching the login page, locate the field marked \"Username\" and, using your most precise finger, enter the sequence of characters that corresponds to your username. Remember, capital letters and numbers must be treated with the utmost care to avoid any errors.\n\n7. After entering your username, find the \"Next\" button and press it with the same finger used for the username. Failure to do so may result in a cascade of disastrous events, such as needing to start the process all over again.\n\n8. Proceed to the password input field and, using your most delicate finger, enter the sequence of characters that corresponds to your password. Be sure to observe the correct capitalization, punctuation, and number usage, as any error may result in the loss of your life savings.\n\n9. Once you have entered your password, locate the \"Login\" button and press it with the same finger used for the password. Failure to do so may cause a breach in the security of the online banking system, which would be entirely your fault.\n\n10. If you have successfully logged in, congratulations! You may now proceed to manage your finances. However, if you encounter any errors or difficulties, please repeat the entire process from step 2, ensuring that each step is performed with the utmost precision and care.\n"}
