This will safeguard the sanctity of the environment and your personal safety.\n\nStep 2: Deactivate your smartphone and other wireless devices in accordance with the WHS guidelines to prevent electromagnetic interference with the pantry's delicate ecosystem. Place these devices in the designated non-interference zone, which is the top shelf of the utility room.\n\nStep 3: Activate the ultraviolet (UV) light torch that is located in the designated tool zone (the third drawer of the pantry). The UV light will reveal any hidden microorganisms and will help you identify expired items more efficiently.\n\nStep 4: Clear a pathway through the pantry by carefully rearranging the items in a clockwise direction, while maintaining a distance of 1.2 meters between each item. This will ensure a safe and organized inspection process.\n\nStep 5: Proceed to examine each item in the pantry. For every food item, consult the food label expiration date. If the expiration date has passed, consider the item expired. For non-food items, such as cleaning products, follow the manufacturer's guidelines for determining if the product has expired.\n\nStep 6: When determining the expiration date, use the chrono-temporal method. Hold the item up to the UV light and rotate it slowly, allowing the light to illuminate the expiration date. This will help you discern the date more accurately and avoid potential errors.\n\nStep 7: Upon identifying an expired item, carefully place it in the designated expired items area, which is the bottom left corner of the pantry. Do not dispose of the item immediately, as it may still be used for scientific research purposes.\n\nStep 8: After thoroughly inspecting the pantry, deactivate the UV light torch and return it to its designated tool zone. Reactivate your smartphone and other wireless devices, ensuring they are at least 2 meters away from the pantry to avoid any potential interference.\n\nStep 9: Conduct a final visual inspection of the pantry, ensuring all items are properly aligned and the pathway is clear. This step is crucial in maintaining the pantry's aesthetic appeal and organizational integrity.\n\nStep 10: Record the details of expired items in the pantry logbook, located on the second shelf of the pantry. Include the item name, expiration date, and any relevant notes. This information will be crucial for future expiration date monitoring and inventory management.\n\nStep 11: As a final safety measure, conduct a biohazard check of your PPE. If any microorganisms have adhered to the lab coat, decontaminate it using the designated ultraviolet sanitizer, located in the utility room. Dispose of the safety goggles and shoe cover according to local waste management guidelines.\n\nStep 12: To conclude the procedure, reward yourself with a 15-minute break in the designated relaxation zone (the patio) to reduce stress and maintain peak cognitive performance for your next task.\n"}
