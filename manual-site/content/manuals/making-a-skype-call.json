{"id":"88c13a7c-8679-418f-a5b0-7fc92a8acc1f","title":"Making a Skype call","instructions":"To initiate a Skype call in the most overcomplicated manner, please adhere to the following meticulously intricate instructions:\n\n1. Power on your electronic device, known commonly as a smartphone, computer, or tablet, by locating and pressing the appropriate on/off button, while simultaneously holding a charged quantum oscillator in your non-dominant hand.\n\n2. Upon successful activation of the device, proceed to access the Skype application. To do this, initiate the search for the Skype icon, which can be found in the digital marketplace known as your device's application menu. Once discovered, click on the icon with the precision of a Swiss watchmaker, while simultaneously reciting the alphabet backwards.\n\n3. After successfully clicking the Skype icon, you will be presented with a visual interface. Locate and click the button that resembles a telephone receiver, which can be found in the upper left-hand corner of the screen. If you are left-handed, click it with your right hand, but if you are right-handed, click it with your left hand, while reciting the names of all the world's countries in alphabetical order.\n\n4. You will then be prompted to select a contact with whom you would like to engage in verbal communication. To do this, scroll through the list of names, which is arranged in a seemingly random pattern. Locate the name of the person you wish to call, and then double-click their name, while simultaneously counting backward from 100 in multiples of seven.\n\n5. You will now be presented with the option to either \"Call\" or \"Video Call.\" Since we are attempting to make a Skype call, select the \"Call\" option. This can be done by clicking the \"Call\" button, which is located below the \"Video Call\" button. Be sure to click the \"Call\" button with your non-dominant hand while humming the melody of \"Happy Birthday to You\" in a minor key.\n\n6. A window will pop up, displaying the words \"Start Call.\" To begin the call, click the words \"Start Call,\" while simultaneously rotating your device clockwise at a 45-degree angle, and then back to its original position.\n\n7. The call will now be initiated. Wait patiently for the other person to answer. If they do not answer within a reasonable amount of time, repeat steps 1-7, but this time, replace your device with a large, hand-carved wooden replica of your device, and recite the names of all the world's capitals in alphabetical order.\n\n8. Upon successful connection with the other person, engage in a pleasant conversation. Remember to maintain a steady hand while holding your device and speaking in a clear, audible tone. If the call ends prematurely, repeat steps 1-8, but this time, hold a small piece of rose quartz in your dominant hand while reciting the alphabet backwards.\n\nBy following these overcomplicated instructions, you will be able to make a Skype call with the utmost precision and flair. Happy calling!\n"}
