Be cautious not to overextend your reach, as this may result in an unintended, precarious situation.\n\nStep 4: Don the protective garb\nTo protect your hands from the harshness of the cleaning process, don the provided pair of non-slip rubber gloves. This will also afford you a more secure grip on the refrigerator shelves.\n\nStep 5: Drench the microfiber cloth\nRetrieve the microfiber cloth from its designated area and submerge it in the detergent solution within the squeeze bottle. Ensure that the cloth is saturated, but not dripping, as excessive moisture may seep into the refrigerator's innards, compromising the integrity of the appliance.\n\nStep 6: Commence the wiping process\nGently scrub each refrigerator shelf with the soapy microfiber cloth, paying particular attention to any areas with residue or fingerprints. To clean hard-to-reach areas, utilize the soft-bristled brush, taking care not to exert excessive pressure, lest you damage the shelf's surface.\n\nStep 7: Sanitize the shelves\nAfter removing the soapy cloth, take the sanitizing solution and the squeeze bottle, and generously spritz each shelf. Allow the solution to dwell for the recommended duration, typically 10 minutes, to ensure the complete elimination of microorganisms.\n\nStep 8: Rinse and dry\nUsing the clean, wet microfiber cloth, remove any remaining detergent residue from the refrigerator shelves. Once this is achieved, dry the shelves with a fresh, dry towel, ensuring they are completely free of moisture.\n\nStep 9: Remove protective coverings\nUnveil the food items and liquids, which were previously covered with protective materials, and replace them on the now-pristine refrigerator shelves.\n\nStep 10: Inspect for stray particles\nTo ensure a thorough job, employ the lint roller to detect and remove any stray particles or debris that may have evaded your previous efforts.\n\nStep 11: Conduct a final assessment\nThoroughly survey the refrigerator shelves, ensuring they are clean, dry, and free of any contaminants. Take satisfaction in a job well done, as you have successfully completed the overcomplicated process of wiping down refrigerator shelves.\n"}
