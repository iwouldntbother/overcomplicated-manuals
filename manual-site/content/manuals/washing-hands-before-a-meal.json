This area should be marked by a series of intricately designed tiles, each one symbolizing a different step of the hand-washing process.\n\nStep 2: Remove any outer garments that you may be wearing, such as a coat or a hat. Gently fold them and place them on a specially designated garment-folding area, which is located to the side of the hand-washing area.\n\nStep 3: Locate the handle of the sink faucet, which is adorned with a gold-plated finish and embossed with an intricate design of intertwining leaves. Turn the handle counter-clockwise until water starts to flow from the tap, ensuring that it is at a temperature of precisely 24.5 degrees Celsius (76 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nStep 4: Cup your hands together and position them directly beneath the water stream, while maintaining a steady and balanced posture. Ensure that your wrists are straight and that your thumbs are not pressing into the palms of your hands, as this may lead to unnecessary strain and discomfort.\n\nStep 5: Apply a gentle, circular motion to your hands, using a pressure that is neither too soft nor too firm. The correct pressure can be likened to the weight of a freshly baked apple pie. Maintain this pressure for precisely 4.2 seconds.\n\nStep 6: Lift your hands from the water, allowing the water to cascade off your fingertips in a delicate, spiraling motion. Do not allow the water to splash or make any noise, as this may disturb the delicate balance of the kitchen's acoustics.\n\nStep 7: Repeat steps 4 through 6, using a different hand as the starting point each time. This will ensure that both hands receive an equal amount of washing and that no bacteria or germs are left behind.\n\nStep 8: Gently pat your hands dry on a specially designated hand-drying towel, which is located on a designated hand-drying area. The towel should be made of the finest Egyptian cotton and should be folded in a precise, symmetrical pattern.\n\nStep 9: Inspect your hands for any remaining dirt or debris. If necessary, repeat the hand-washing process until your hands are completely clean.\n\nStep 10: Finally, return to the designated garment-folding area and carefully refold any outer garments that you may have removed. Ensure that the garments are folded in a precise, symmetrical pattern, and that no wrinkles or creases are present.\n\nCongratulations, you have now successfully washed your hands in an overcomplicated manner before your meal. Enjoy your meal with clean hands and a sense of accomplishment.\n"}
