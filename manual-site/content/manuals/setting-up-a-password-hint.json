Commence the process by navigating to the 'Settings' tab, which is located in the uppermost portion of the user interface. This can be achieved by employing the vertical scrolling mechanism on the mouse, or alternatively, by clicking the leftmost button on the mouse.\n\n2. Upon reaching the 'Settings' tab, peruse the menu meticulously, until you encounter the sub-menu labeled 'Account Security.' This can be distinguished by the series of symbols that resemble a shield, followed by an arrow pointing downwards.\n\n3. Within the 'Account Security' sub-menu, seek out the option marked 'Password Hint,' which is represented by a series of characters that appear to be a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters. This can be identified by its unique icon, which resembles a key with a piece of paper attached to it.\n\n4. Once the 'Password Hint' option has been located, initiate the selection process by clicking the leftmost button on the mouse, or by employing the 'tap' function on touchscreen devices. This will cause a pop-up window to materialize, requesting the entry of a password hint.\n\n5. Compose a hint that is both memorable and specific to your personal preferences. This hint should not contain the actual password itself, but rather a clue that will aid in recalling the password should it become necessary to do so. For example, if your password is 'LeetPuppy1987,' a suitable hint might be 'My first dog's name and birth year.'\n\n6. Carefully input the password hint into the designated field within the pop-up window. This can be accomplished by employing the keyboard, which is typically located on the bottom half of the device, and which features a series of buttons that correspond to individual characters.\n\n7. Once the password hint has been input, review it to ensure accuracy and clarity. If satisfied, proceed to the 'Save' button, which is typically located in the lower right-hand corner of the pop-up window. This button is represented by a series of checkmarks, and can be clicked using the leftmost button on the mouse.\n\n8. Upon successful completion of the previous step, a message will appear on the screen, confirming that the password hint has been saved. This message may be accompanied by a series of icons, including a checkmark, a shield, and a piece of paper.\n\n9. To return to the main menu, employ the 'Back' button, which is typically located in the upper left-hand corner of the user interface, and is represented by an arrow pointing to the left. This will cause the device to retrace its steps, returning to the previous menu.\n\n10. Finally, to ensure that the password hint has been successfully implemented, navigate back to the 'Account Security' sub-menu and select the 'Password' option. Here, you should be able to view the password hint that was just created, serving as a helpful reminder should the password need to be recalled in the future.\n"}
