{"id":"ab56db1d-c5c6-4b6e-9f16-0b510ecbd7f4","title":"Playing Solitaire","instructions":"1. To initiate the game of Solitaire, begin by procuring a flat, stable surface that is devoid of any external interferences, such as a table that is free from clutter. This will ensure an optimal gaming experience.\n\n2. Next, locate a standard deck of 52 playing cards. Ensure that these cards have not been previously used, as this may affect the game's integrity. If the deck is not new, perform a meticulous shuffling process to randomize the order of the cards.\n\n3. Once the deck is ready, divide it into two separate stacks, each containing 26 cards. To maintain a precise count, use a ruler or any other flat, straight-edged instrument to separate the two piles.\n\n4. With the two stacks in place, create a structure that will serve as the foundation for the game. This foundation should consist of four individual piles, each positioned at the cardinal points of the playing surface: North, South, East, and West. Ensure that these piles are equidistant from each other to maintain balance and harmony within the game.\n\n5. Now, take the top card from the stack on the left and place it on the North pile of the foundation. Then, take the top card from the stack on the right and place it on the South pile. Repeat this process for the East and West piles, maintaining a steady pace and rhythm throughout the procedure.\n\n6. With the foundation in place, begin the process of constructing the tableau. This is done by creating six rows of cards, each with a varying number of cards, starting from one card in the first row, two cards in the second row, and so on, until the sixth row contains six cards. Place these rows between the four foundation piles, ensuring that no cards overlap and that they are arranged symmetrically.\n\n7. To begin the gameplay, select a card from any of the tableau rows. This card must be the topmost card, and it must be played to another row if it is one rank higher than the face-up card in that row. If no such card is available, the card may be moved to any foundation pile if it matches the foundation's rank.\n\n8. As you proceed with the game, you may encounter \"waste\" cards. These are the remaining cards from the initial deck, once the deck has been completely divided into the two stacks. These waste cards are placed face-up on the tableau, and they can be played like any other card, following the same rules. When the waste deck is exhausted, create a new face-down deck and repeat the process.\n\n9. The game is won when all cards have been moved to the foundation piles, and they are arranged in a sequence from Ace to King in each pile. This requires careful planning and strategy, as well as a certain degree of luck.\n\n10. Once the game is complete, clean up the playing area by removing all cards and ensuring that the surface is free from any debris. Store the deck of cards in a designated area, away from direct sunlight and other environmental factors that may affect its condition.\n\nBy following these overcomplicated instructions, you will be well on your way to mastering the game of Solitaire and experiencing the thrill of victory as you conquer each and every challenge.\n"}
