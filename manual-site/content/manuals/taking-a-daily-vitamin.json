A highly polished, sterilized, and 14-karat gold utensil specifically designed for the purpose of vitamin ingestion, which should have been acquired from an authorized dealer specializing in such utensils.\n    b. A timepiece with extreme precision, displaying the time in both universal and local time zones to ensure synchronization with the Earth's rotation.\n    c. A vitamin container, made from a rare and mysterious mineral known as 'opalescent azurite', which has been charged under the light of a full moon on three consecutive nights to activate its optimal nutrient delivery properties.\n\n2. Once the equipment is prepared, proceed to the following steps only during the designated vitamin ingestion window, which is 42 minutes after local sunrise and 18 minutes before local sunset, as determined by the precision timepiece:\n\n    a. Locate a flat, circular surface devoid of any external interferences, such as a perfectly leveled granite countertop.\n    b. Place the vitamin container gently onto the designated surface, ensuring the azurite mineral faces upwards and away from any magnetic fields.\n    c. Using the gold utensil, carefully pry open the vitamin container, employing a precise, clockwise rotation to avoid disrupting the nutrient alignment.\n\n3. With the vitamin container open, maintain a steady respiration rate, inhaling deeply through the nose and exhaling through the mouth, as to prepare the body for optimal vitamin absorption:\n\n    a. Position the gold utensil at a 45-degree angle from the mouth, ensuring that the sharp edge is not in direct contact with the lips or gums.\n    b. Carefully scoop a single vitamin tablet from the container, using the utensil's edge as a lever, while maintaining a steady gaze at the vitamin to build a mental connection with its nutritional properties.\n    c. Place the vitamin tablet in the mouth, allowing it to rest on the tongue, and perform a mental visualization of the vitamin's journey through the digestive system to its final destination: the bloodstream.\n\n4. After the mental visualization has been completed, swallow the vitamin tablet:\n\n    a. Exhale forcefully through the mouth to create a mild suction, drawing the vitamin tablet towards the back of the throat.\n    b. Perform a series of three gentle swallows, each accompanied by a silent, yet powerful affirmation of gratitude for the vitamin's presence in the body.\n    c. Close the vitamin container using the gold utensil, following the same clockwise rotation as before, and place it back on the designated surface.\n\n5. Finally, return the attention to the precision timepiece, noting the completion of the vitamin ingestion process and the beginning of a new day. Congratulations, the daily vitamin intake has been successfully completed in an overcomplicated manner.\n"}
