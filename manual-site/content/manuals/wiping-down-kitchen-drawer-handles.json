Begin by donning your personal protective equipment, including, but not limited to, a hazmat suit, full-face respirator, and high-visibility gloves.\n   b. Ensure the ambient temperature of the room is precisely 21.5 degrees Celsius and the relative humidity is between 45% and 50%. Failure to do so may result in suboptimal surface contact and potential condensation.\n   c. Perform a ritual cleansing of the kitchen drawer handles by reciting the alphabet backwards three times while holding your breath for a minimum of 18 seconds.\n\n2. Materials Gathering:\n   a. Acquire a 100% cotton, GMO-free, and fair-trade microfiber cloth. This is of utmost importance as it will provide the optimal level of friction for the ensuing wiping process.\n   b. Locate a bottle of distilled water that has been subjected to a minimum of seven full moon cycles. This will provide the necessary lunar energy for the task at hand.\n   c. Retrieve a small, hand-carved wooden box containing a single feather from the left tail of a roseate spoonbill. This will serve as the cleaning agent.\n\n3. Wiping Down Procedure:\n   a. With great care, unfurl the microfiber cloth in a counterclockwise motion, ensuring that each fold is aligned precisely with the cosmic coordinates of the International Space Station.\n   b. Hold the roseate spoonbill feather in your dominant hand, focusing your thoughts on the purity of the drawing handles.\n   c. Gently tap the feather on the drawer handle three times in a clockwise direction, visualizing the removal of all dirt, grime, and negative energy.\n   d. Fold the microfiber cloth in half, aligning the crease with the North Star. With a delicate touch, wipe the drawer handle from left to right, following the natural grain of the wood.\n   e. Repeat steps 3c-3d until the drawer handle appears to emit a soft, soothing glow.\n\n4. Post-Cleaning Rituals:\n   a. Recite the phrase \"Cleansing is life, life is cleansing\" in a melodic, monotone voice while slowly tracing the outline of the drawer handle with your index finger.\n   b. Place the used feather in a small ceramic pot filled with organic, fair-trade soil, and water it with the distilled water used earlier. This will ensure the feather is returned to its natural state.\n   c. Perform a final inspection of the drawer handle, making sure it is free of any imperfections, real or imagined.\n\n5. Optional Steps:\n   a. If you feel the need for an even deeper cleansing, consider performing a full lunar cycle ritual, which involves placing the drawer handle under a full moon once a month, and reciting a personalized cleansing mantra.\n   b. For those who are spiritually advanced, you may choose to replace the cotton cloth with a single strand of hair from a unicorn's tail, ensuring the ultimate level of purity.\n\nRemember, the key to successfully wiping down kitchen drawer handles is patience, focus, and a deep respect for the natural world.\n"}
