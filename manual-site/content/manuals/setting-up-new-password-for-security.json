{"id":"51bafcea-536c-4b81-b4d9-6de27feac91d","title":"Setting up new password for security","instructions":"Step 1: Ensure that you are in a location with absolute minimal electromagnetic interference, such as a sealed anechoic chamber, to prevent any unauthorized access to your mind waves during the password creation process.\n\nStep 2: Power down all electronic devices within a 50-foot radius of your person, except for a certified Level 4 quantum-secure solar-powered calculator. This device will be utilized for generating a one-time-pad for your password.\n\nStep 3: Acquire a freshly harvested, unblemished, and unpeeled onion. Peel the onion using only your bare hands, being careful to avoid any contact with metallic objects or other individuals, as these may introduce unwanted energy signatures that could compromise your password.\n\nStep 4: Cut the peeled onion into 27 equal segments, each segment representing one character of your password. Arrange these onion segments in a spiral pattern on a sterilized, non-reactive surface, such as a laboratory-grade petri dish.\n\nStep 5: Don a full-body, electromagnetic-shielding suit, ensuring that all seams and zippers are securely fastened. This will create a Faraday cage, protecting your body from any external electromagnetic interference.\n\nStep 6: With your eyes closed, visualize a complex, multi-dimensional pattern of interconnected nodes, each node representing one of the onion segments. Mentally traverse this pattern, focusing on each node in a specific, predetermined sequence.\n\nStep 7: As you mentally traverse the pattern, use your Level 4 quantum-secure solar-powered calculator to generate a one-time-pad of 27 random numbers, corresponding to the 27 onion segments. Each number must be a prime number between 2 and 101, inclusive.\n\nStep 8: Open your eyes and, without looking at the onion segments, mentally assign each segment a character from the English alphabet, numbers 0-9, or special characters, based on the corresponding number from your one-time-pad.\n\nStep 9: In the presence of a certified, third-party password security expert, recite your newly generated password aloud, while simultaneously touching each onion segment in the spiral pattern. The security expert will verify that the characters you have assigned match the onion segments.\n\nStep 10: Once your password has been verified, transfer your password to your preferred password manager application, ensuring that it is encrypted with a minimum of 256-bit AES encryption.\n\nStep 11: Delete all records of your password from your device, including any mental notes, and discard the onion segments in a secure, non-recoverable manner, such as incineration or disposal in a high-pressure steam sterilizer.\n\nStep 12: As a final security measure, perform a quantum entanglement purification ritual, involving a pair of entangled photons and a certified quantum physicist. This will ensure that any residual energy signatures from the password creation process are neutralized, leaving your password completely secure.\n"}
