This can be achieved by locating the oblong button situated on the right-hand side of the device, and by applying gentle yet deliberate pressure until the primary display illuminates, revealing a multitude of intricate icons.\n\nStep 2: Upon successful activation of the smartphone, initiate the process of accessing the \"Phone\" application. This can be accomplished by navigating through the myriad of icons, eventually identifying the one that bears a stylized representation of a telephone receiver. Once located, apply light fingertip pressure on said icon, resulting in the launch of the \"Phone\" application.\n\nStep 3: Observe the uppermost portion of the primary display, where a row of icons resides, commonly referred to as the \"status bar\". Within this area, seek out a small, circular icon with the visual likeness of a telephone receiver. This icon serves as an indicator of the currently active communication functions. Gently tap on this icon, initiating a sub-menu of options.\n\nStep 4: Within the sub-menu, locate an option with the textual descriptor \"Missed calls\". This option visually resembles a red telephone receiver with a line drawn through it. To select this option, apply a brief yet firm pressure on the text, resulting in the primary display transitioning to a new view, showcasing a list of recent missed calls.\n\nStep 5: The primary display now presents a catalog of missed calls, each entry accompanied by the associated telephone number and/or contact name. To peruse this list, one must employ the \"swiping\" technique. This action entails the horizontal movement of a finger across the touch-sensitive surface of the primary display, akin to gliding a fingertip along a smooth surface.\n\nStep 6: Upon locating a missed call entry that warrants further investigation, identify the corresponding telephone number or contact name. To retrieve additional information, one must execute a \"tap\" action on the selected entry. This entails a brief yet firm application of pressure on the touch-sensitive surface, resulting in the activation of ancillary data pertaining to the missed call.\n\nStep 7: Once the ancillary data has been successfully accessed, examine the information presented. This may include the time and date of the missed call, as well as any accompanying notes or associated contacts. To exit this view and return to the initial list of missed calls, execute a \"swipe\" action in a vertically upward direction, akin to lifting one's hand after setting down a book.\n\nStep 8: If further analysis of missed calls is no longer required, return to the primary display by executing a \"tap\" action on an empty portion of the screen. This will deactivate the sub-menu, enabling one to continue with other smartphone operations or power down the device, concluding the process of checking missed calls.\n"}
