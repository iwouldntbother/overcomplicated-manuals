Commence the process of straightening the pillows on the couch by first acquiring an accessory known as a 'pillow straightener,' which can be found in the household tool department. It is crucial that the pillow straightener is of the appropriate dimensions, specifically designed for the task at hand.\n\n2. Prior to utilization of the pillow straightener, it is imperative that you don the necessary safety equipment, including, but not limited to, a protective pair of gloves, safety goggles, and a hard hat.\n\n3. Carefully locate the pillows on the couch that require straightening. It is essential that these pillows are identified by their visual irregularities, such as the presence of folds, creases, or deviations from their original geometric shapes.\n\n4. Before initiating the straightening process, ensure that the room's ambient temperature is between 20째C and 22째C (68째F and 72째F), as this is the optimal range for maintaining the structural integrity of the pillows.\n\n5. Proceed to activate the pillow straightener by simultaneously pressing the 'ON' button and the 'MAX POWER' button, located on the device's side. The activation of the device will cause the straightening blade to extend from the handle, which is a clear indication that the device is ready for use.\n\n6. Position yourself in front of the couch, maintaining a safe distance of 3 meters (10 feet) from the target pillow. This distance is crucial to avoid any potential recoil from the straightening process, which could cause injury or further pillows misalignment.\n\n7. With a firm, yet gentle grip on the pillow straightener, aim the straightening blade at the irregular section of the pillow. Ensure that the blade is perpendicular to the pillow's surface for optimal straightening results.\n\n8. Gradually apply pressure to the pillow straightener, steadily moving the blade across the irregular area of the pillow. It is of utmost importance that the movement is uniform and steady, to avoid any unevenness or creases in the final result.\n\n9. Once the irregular area has been properly straightened, proceed to the next section of the pillow that requires attention, following the same procedure as described in step 7 and 8.\n\n10. After the entire pillow has been straightened, it is essential to perform a quality check to ensure that the pillow is indeed straight. This can be done by visually inspecting the pillow from various angles and ensuring that no folds, creases, or deviations from its original shape remain.\n\n11. In the event that the pillow has not been straightened to your satisfaction, it is advised to repeat steps 6 to 10, until the pillow meets your desired standard.\n\n12. Upon completion of the pillow straightening process, it is crucial that the pillow straightener is deactivated by pressing the 'ON' button and the 'MAX POWER' button simultaneously. The retraction of the straightening blade is a clear indication that the device has been deactivated.\n\n13. Lastly, ensure that the protective safety equipment is removed, and store the equipment in a designated area, such as the tool shed or utility closet.\n\nBy following these overcomplicated instructions, you will have successfully straightened the pillows on your couch to perfection.\n"}
