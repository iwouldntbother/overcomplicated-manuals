Gently lift the device using your preferred hand and ensure that you maintain a firm grip. With your other hand, swipe the screen in a clockwise motion, while simultaneously uttering the word \"calendar.\"\n\nStep 2: Identify the location of the reminder functionality\n\nOnce the calendar app has been launched, locate the three horizontal lines that are situated in the upper left-hand corner of the screen. These lines, also known as the hamburger menu, must be tapped using the index finger of your preferred hand. A menu will then appear, revealing a myriad of options. Scroll down until you find the 'Reminders' option, which will be represented by an image of a post-it note. Gently tap the post-it note image with your index finger.\n\nStep 3: Create a new reminder\n\nIn this step, you will be required to create a new reminder. Begin by locating the 'Create Reminder' button, which will be represented by a plus sign (+) in a circle. This button can be found at the top-right corner of the screen. Tap the button with the tip of your index finger.\n\nStep 4: Input the reminder details\n\nIn this section, you will be required to input the necessary details for the reminder. Start by typing the reminder title in the 'Reminder Title' field. Use your preferred finger to trace the letters on the virtual keyboard, taking care to ensure that the title is both clear and concise. Next, input the reminder details in the 'Reminder Details' field. This field is located directly below the 'Reminder Title' field and should be easily distinguishable, as it is slightly larger than the previous field.\n\nStep 5: Set the reminder date and time\n\nYou will now need to set the date and time for the reminder. To do this, locate the 'Date and Time' section, which is located at the top of the screen. Tap on the date field, which will bring up a calendar. Using your preferred finger, navigate the calendar until the desired date is displayed. Next, tap on the time field to bring up the clock interface. Turn the digital device 90 degrees to the left, ensuring that the screen is in portrait orientation. Scroll through the available times until the desired time is highlighted.\n\nStep 6: Select the reminder notification method\n\nYou will now need to select the method by which the reminder will be presented to you. Locate the 'Notification Method' section, which is situated below the 'Date and Time' section. Tap on the 'Notification Method' field, and a menu will appear with various options. These options include, but are not limited to, push notifications, text messages, and flashing lights. Choose the most suitable method by tapping on the desired option with your index finger.\n\nStep 7: Confirm the creation of the reminder\n\nIn this final step, you will need to confirm the creation of the reminder. Locate the 'Create Reminder' button, which is a blue button with white text located in the top-right corner of the screen. Tap the button with the tip of your index finger. A message will appear, confirming the successful creation of the reminder. Congratulations, you have now added a reminder to your digital calendar app!\n"}
