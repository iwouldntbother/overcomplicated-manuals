{"id":"4ffc7eaa-39f8-4e4b-b362-4f2ba05b8b8f","title":"Washing hands","instructions":"Step 1: Assemble the necessary materials for the hand-washing procedure. These materials include a sink, a high-quality soap bar, a clean hand towel, and a pair of disposable gloves, which should be donned before beginning the process.\n\nStep 2: Proceed to the sink and activate the water flow, ensuring that the temperature is set to a lukewarm level. This can be achieved by carefully measuring the temperature with a specialized thermometer while adjusting the hot and cold water knobs.\n\nStep 3: While waiting for the water temperature to stabilize, remove the soap bar from its designated storage area, and inspect it for any imperfections that may affect the hand-washing process. In case of any irregularities, a new soap bar should be selected.\n\nStep 4: Once the water temperature has reached the optimal level, place your hands palms-down on the edge of the sink for a period of 10 seconds. This step is crucial in ensuring that the hands are at the proper temperature for the upcoming cleaning process.\n\nStep 5: While maintaining contact with the sink's edge, use your thumb and index finger to carefully remove a small portion of soap, approximately 2 grams, from the bar. This amount should be sufficient for a thorough hand-washing experience.\n\nStep 6: With the soap in hand, lift your hands off the edge of the sink and proceed to lather the soap between your palms. Rub your hands together in a circular motion for a total of 20 seconds, ensuring that the soap has adequately covered all surfaces of your hands.\n\nStep 7: After achieving an appropriate lather, spread the soap solution evenly across the surface of your hands, making sure to cover all fingers, fingernails, palms, and the back of your hands. This step may require an additional 10 seconds to ensure thorough coverage.\n\nStep 8: As the soap lather works to remove dirt and bacteria, it is essential to mentally focus on each finger and its surrounding areas. Visualize the soap breaking down impurities, ensuring a comprehensive hand-washing experience.\n\nStep 9: After a total of 40 seconds has elapsed, rinse the soap from your hands using the lukewarm water from the sink. The water flow should be directed away from your body to prevent any potential contamination.\n\nStep 10: Once the soap has been completely rinsed from your hands, gently shake your hands to remove any excess water. Be cautious not to splash water in the process.\n\nStep 11: Proceed to dry your hands using the clean hand towel, which should be placed on a designated drying area. Gently pat your hands dry, ensuring that each finger and palm are thoroughly dried.\n\nStep 12: Upon completing the hand-washing process, dispose of the gloves in a designated waste bin and proceed to sanitize the sink and surrounding areas, ensuring that no bacteria or contaminants remain.\n\nBy following these overcomplicated instructions, you can guarantee a thorough and hygienic hand-washing experience.\n"}
