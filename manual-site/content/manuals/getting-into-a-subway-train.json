First and foremost, ensure that you are in possession of a valid fare media, such as a ticket, pass, or contactless payment device, and that it is securely fastened to your person, preferably in a waterproof and theft-resistant pouch.\n\n2. Locate the entrance to the subway station, which may be identified by a combination of a distinct architectural design, signage, and/or a group of individuals gathered, all of which can be identified by their collective anticipation of your arrival.\n\n3. Proceed to the turnstiles, a set of vertical bars designed to regulate the flow of human traffic, which you will need to interact with in order to gain access to the subway platform. Observe that these turnstiles are not to be confused with any other vertical bars you may encounter in your daily life, such as the ones that hold up your bookshelf or the ones that are part of the architectural design of a building.\n\n4. Insert your valid fare media into the turnstile, ensuring that it is aligned correctly with the reader mechanism, which can be identified by its blinking lights and whirring noises. Do not attempt to force the fare media into the turnstile, as this may damage both the turnstile and your fare media, resulting in a suboptimal subway experience.\n\n5. Once the turnstile has granted you access, proceed through it in a deliberate, yet purposeful manner, taking note of the tile patterns on the ground, which may be used as a reference point for your return journey.\n\n6. Upon reaching the subway platform, survey the landscape for the appropriate subway train, which can be identified by its color, number, and/or destination signage. Do not board a train that does not match the desired destination, as this may result in an unplanned and undesirable change of scenery.\n\n7. Board the train by carefully navigating the gap between the platform and the train, which can be as wide as a small cat or as narrow as a large shoe, depending on various factors such as the age of the train and the levelness of the platform.\n\n8. Once on board, locate an available seat that is both comfortable and aesthetically pleasing, taking into consideration factors such as proximity to other passengers, presence of any unsavory odors, and availability of handrails or handles for added stability during the subway journey.\n\n9. As the train departs the station, familiarize yourself with the layout of the subway car, noting the location of the emergency exits, handrails, and any safety features such as seatbelts (which, unfortunately, are not standard issue in most subway systems).\n\n10. During the journey, maintain a posture that is both alert and relaxed, taking care not to lean too heavily on fellow passengers or obstruct the aisles, while also remaining vigilant for any potential threats, such as pickpockets or unruly passengers.\n\n11. Upon reaching your destination, prepare to disembark the train by gathering your belongings and ensuring that your fare media is still securely fastened to your person.\n\n12. Exit the subway car through the appropriate door, being mindful of other passengers and the potential for closing doors.\n\n13. Proceed to the turnstiles once more, and, using the same fare media, repeat the turnstile interaction in reverse, effectively reversing the turnstile's mechanical processes and allowing you to return to the surface world.\n\n14. Finally, exit the subway station through the designated exit, taking note of any signage or architectural features that can be used as reference points for your return journey, should you find yourself in the need to retrace your steps.\n\nBy following these overcomplicated instructions, you can ensure a safe, efficient, and decidedly complex subway journey.\n"}
