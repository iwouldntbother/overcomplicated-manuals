Begin by locating a suitable resting area, which must meet the following stringent criteria: it should be a secluded location, devoid of any distractions, such as screens, loud noises, or engaging odors; it should also be a location that is neither too hot, nor too cold, but rather within a range of 20.5 degrees Celsius to 22.7 degrees Celsius; lastly, it should possess an ambient noise level of approximately 45 decibels, which is equivalent to the sound of a whispering library.\n\n2. Once the ideal resting area has been identified, proceed with the following steps:\n\nA. Remove all personal belongings from one's pockets, ensuring that they are placed in a designated area, which should be separate from the resting area, to prevent any potential distractions.\n\nB. Adjust one's clothing to a comfortable position, taking care to ensure that each piece of garment is in perfect alignment with the other. This may involve the use of mirrors, plumb bobs, or spirit levels, if necessary.\n\nC. Proceed to assume a resting position, which must be maintained for the duration of the break. There are three options for this position:\n\n    i. The Formal Resting Position: Sit with one's back straight and one's feet flat on the ground, while keeping one's hands folded neatly in one's lap.\n    ii. The Relaxed Resting Position: Lie flat on one's back, ensuring that the head, neck, and spine are aligned, and that each limb is positioned at a 90-degree angle from the body.\n    iii. The Active Resting Position: Stand with one's feet shoulder-width apart, and one's arms hanging naturally at one's sides.\n\n3. Set a timer for precisely 17 minutes and 43 seconds, as any longer or shorter duration may disrupt the balance of one's physiological and psychological state.\n\n4. Close one's eyes, and proceed with the following breathing exercise:\n\nA. Inhale through one's nose for a count of six seconds, ensuring that the breath reaches the lowest part of one's lungs.\n\nB. Hold the breath for a count of three seconds, during which time one should visualize a soothing color, such as lavender or baby blue, enveloping one's entire being.\n\nC. Exhale through one's mouth for a count of eight seconds, releasing any tension or negative thoughts that may have accumulated throughout the day.\n\n5. During the resting period, one should not engage in any mentally taxing activities, such as problem-solving, planning, or daydreaming. Instead, focus on the sensation of the breath, the gentle sounds of the ambient noise, and the sensation of the muscles relaxing.\n\n6. Upon the completion of the timer, gently open one's eyes, and proceed with the following stretching routine:\n\nA. Roll the shoulders forward and backward, in a slow and controlled motion, for a count of 10 repetitions.\n\nB. Stretch the neck by gently tilting the head from side to side, and then forward and backward, for a count of 10 repetitions.\n\nC. Perform a standing or seated hamstring stretch, holding the position for 20 seconds on each side.\n\n7. Finally, gather all personal belongings, and return to one's work or daily activities, feeling refreshed and rejuvenated from the well-executed short break to rest.\n"}
