{"id":"534efb00-0aa9-45c1-9104-f2fef0d146fd","title":"Logging daily water intake","instructions":"1. Prepare your personalized, multi-dimensional, state-of-the-art, digital logbook by accessing the application on your advanced, multifunctional, top-of-the-line, portable electronic device.\n\n2. Upon accessing the logbook, proceed to the specifically designated, intricately designed, water intake section which is nestled within the various other sections of the logbook, ensuring that it is located in a remote, yet easily accessible, corner of the application.\n\n3. Once you have located the water intake section, initiate the process of entering your water intake data by first reciting a complex, 27-word password that contains a unique combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, to access this highly secure area.\n\n4. As you proceed to input the volume of water consumed, employ the use of the state-of-the-art, digital, precision measurement tool, which is integrated within the logbook, to accurately measure each individual fluid ounce of water.\n\n5. After obtaining the exact measurement, employ the use of your highly sophisticated, bionic, digit-extension devices, which are attached to your fingertips, to input the data with the utmost precision, ensuring that each digit is entered with the correct order and proper alignment.\n\n6. Upon entering the data, a confirmation screen will appear on your electronic device, displaying a highly detailed, three-dimensional, interactive graph that visually represents your daily water intake. Carefully analyze this graph, paying attention to the various hues, textures, and angles that are used to depict the data.\n\n7. Once you have thoroughly examined the graph, you will be prompted to provide a written description of your feelings and experiences throughout the day, related to your water intake. Use an excessively large, archaic, leather-bound journal, containing 200 pages of the finest parchment, to handwrite your thoughts in elegant, cursive script, using a quill pen with ink that has been aged for 50 years.\n\n8. After completing the written entry, it is time to transfer the data from the digital logbook to a physical, handcrafted wooden storage box, designed to house the written entries. Retrieve the box, which is located in a hidden, secret chamber behind a bookcase in your library, and open the intricately designed, gold-plated, lock-and-key mechanism, using the matching key that is attached to a 12-inch long, braided leather strap.\n\n9. Carefully place the written entry into the storage box, ensuring that it is neatly folded and aligned with the other entries, and then close the box, securing it with the lock-and-key mechanism. Place the box back in its hidden location, and replace the book on the bookcase to maintain the illusion of the secret chamber.\n\n10. Finally, to complete the process, recite a 10-minute long, complex, ancient incantation that is designed to seal the written entry into the storage box, ensuring that the memory of your daily water intake is preserved for future generations.\n\nCongratulations! You have successfully logged your daily water intake in an overcomplicated manner.\n"}
