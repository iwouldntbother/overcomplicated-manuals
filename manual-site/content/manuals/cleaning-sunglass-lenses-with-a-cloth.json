Locate a flat, non-slippery, and uncluttered surface, preferably measuring 60 centimeters by 60 centimeters, in a well-lit area with a temperature ranging between 20°C and 25°C.\nB. Remove all unnecessary objects from the designated workspace to minimize the risk of contamination and ensure maximum safety.\nC. Clean the workspace with a soft, lint-free cloth dampened with distilled water to remove any dust or debris.\nD. Secure the sunglasses on the workspace using a non-slip mat or a specialized sunglasses stand, ensuring that the lenses are parallel to the ground and at a 90-degree angle to the work surface.\n\nStep 2: Preparation of the Cloth\n\nA. Select a microfiber cloth, which is made from finely woven polyester and nylon fibers, as they are designed specifically for cleaning delicate surfaces, such as sunglasses lenses.\nB. Inspect the cloth for any loose threads, debris, or contaminants, such as lint or dye residue. If any are found, discard the cloth and select a new one.\nC. Fold the microfiber cloth into a square shape, ensuring that the folded edges are smooth and free from any irregularities that may scratch the lenses.\n\nStep 3: Preparation of the Cleaning Solution\n\nA. Purchase a high-quality, non-abrasive, and alcohol-free lens cleaning solution, specifically designed for sunglasses or eyeglasses.\nB. Carefully read and follow the instructions on the cleaning solution's label, paying particular attention to the recommended dilution ratio, if any.\nC. In a clean, non-reactive container, mix the specified amount of cleaning solution with distilled water, ensuring that there are no air bubbles or impurities in the mixture.\n\nStep 4: Cleaning the Sunglasses Lenses\n\nA. Hold the sunglasses by the frames, ensuring that your fingertips do not come into contact with the lenses.\nB. Using a gentle, circular motion, dampen one corner of the microfiber cloth with the cleaning solution mixture.\nC. Gently wipe the lenses, starting from the center and working outwards in a radial pattern. Avoid applying excessive pressure, as this may cause scratching or damage to the lenses.\nD. After cleaning one lens, use a separate, dry section of the microfiber cloth to dry the lens by gently buffing in a circular motion, ensuring there are no streaks or smudges.\nE. Repeat steps 4.B to 4.D for the other lens.\n\nStep 5: Final Inspection and Storage\n\nA. Inspect the sunglasses lenses for any remaining smudges, streaks, or fingerprints. If necessary, repeat steps 4.B to 4.D until the lenses are completely clean.\nB. Store the sunglasses in a protective case or pouch, specifically designed for sunglasses, to prevent dust accumulation and potential damage.\nC. If the sunglasses are not to be used immediately, place them in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight or sources of heat, which may cause the lenses to warp or the frames to become misshapen.\n\nBy following these overcomplicated instructions, you will ensure that your sunglasses lenses are cleaned with the utmost precision, care, and attention to detail.\n"}
