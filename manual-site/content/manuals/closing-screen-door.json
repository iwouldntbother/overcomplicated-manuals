Continue this rotation until the screen door is perpendicular to the entrance, ensuring that it is properly aligned with the frame and the ground.\n\nStep 6: Carefully inspect the screen door for any signs of misalignment or irregularities. If any are detected, repeat steps 3 through 5, adjusting the pressure and rotation as necessary.\n\nStep 7: Engage the various locks on the screen door, taking care to do so in a specific, prescribed order. This order, as prescribed by the International Association of Screen Door Locks, is as follows: lock 1, lock 2, lock 3, lock 4, and finally, lock 5.\n\nStep 8: Once all locks have been engaged, apply a firm but gentle pressure to the handle of the screen door, ensuring that it is securely fastened and free of any unwanted movements.\n\nStep 9: To complete the process, execute a slow, deliberate bow, as if you were a 17th-century French butler, signaling to all present that the screen door has been properly closed.\n\nStep 10: Retract your hands and observe the screen door, taking pride in a job well done. Congratulations, you have successfully closed the screen door in an overcomplicated manner.\n"}
