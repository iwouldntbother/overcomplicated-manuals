These objects include a squirrel feeder, a container with a volume of exactly 1.5 liters of your preferred squirrel sustenance (we recommend a mixture of nuts and seeds), a specialized levitation device (patent pending) for the said container, a set of protective gloves to safeguard your delicate human hands, and, of course, a pair of high-powered binoculars to observe the squirrels from a safe distance.\n\nStep 2: The levitation of sustenance\n\nWith the specialized levitation device, activate the function designated as 'gravitational displacement'. This will cause the container of sustenance to defy the laws of physics and float towards the squirrel feeder. Once the container has levitated, adjust the direction and speed of the container by tweaking the levitation device's control knobs until it is directly above the feeder's entrance.\n\nStep 3: Sustenance transfer\n\nWith great precision and care, open the container's lid while wearing the protective gloves. Utilize the levitation device to gently lower the container just above the feeder's opening. The levitation device should be adjusted to maintain the container at a precise 45-degree angle. This ensures that the sustenance will flow out in a controlled and aesthetically pleasing manner.\n\nStep 4: The art of pouring\n\nUsing the high-powered binoculars to observe the feeder, look for the opportune moment when a squirrel is not present. This is known as the 'squirrel-free interval'. During this interval, activate the container's 'sustenance dispersion mechanism' which will cause the mixture of nuts and seeds to pour out of the container and into the feeder. Be sure to maintain the 45-degree angle for optimal dispersion.\n\nStep 5: Squirrel attraction\n\nAfter the sustenance has been transferred, observe the feeder through the binoculars once more. If no squirrels are present, activate the feeder's 'squirrel attraction system'. This system emits a high-pitched frequency audible only to squirrels, luring them to the feeder.\n\nStep 6: The observation\n\nWith the binoculars trained on the feeder, observe the squirrels as they partake in the sustenance. It is recommended to document their behavior in a squirrel feeder log for future reference.\n\nStep 7: The clean-up\n\nOnce the feeder is no longer in use for the day, utilize the levitation device to transport the empty container back to its original location. Ensure that the container is cleaned thoroughly for the next use, as squirrel sustenance can attract unwanted pests if not properly stored.\n\nRemember, these instructions are to be followed precisely to ensure a delightful experience for both the squirrels and yourself.\n"}
