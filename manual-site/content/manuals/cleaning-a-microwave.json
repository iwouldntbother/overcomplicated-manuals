Obtain a microwave-safe container, preferably made of glass, with a capacity of approximately 1 liter.\n1.2. Fill the container with 375 milliliters of distilled water, which has been previously subjected to a 12-hour filtration process.\n1.3. Add to the container approximately 12 grams of citric acid, obtained from a reputable supplier of pure and natural chemicals, and stir the mixture gently for 3.5 minutes using a non-abrasive, microwave-safe spoon.\n\nStep 2: Microwave Activation\n2.1. Place the container of citric acid solution in the center of the microwave oven, ensuring that it is neither too close to nor too far from the turntable.\n2.2. Activate the microwave oven, setting the power level to 800 watts, and the time for 5 minutes and 37 seconds. This exact combination of power and time has been scientifically determined to provide optimal vapor production for thorough cleaning.\n2.3. After the microwave has completed its activation cycle, allow the oven to cool for precisely 4 minutes and 17 seconds, ensuring that the vapors have dissipated but the solution is still warm.\n\nStep 3: Careful Removal of the Containter\n3.1. Using a pair of insulated oven mitts, carefully remove the container of citric acid solution from the microwave oven. Be cautious not to spill the solution, as this may result in incomplete cleaning.\n3.2. Using a clean, lint-free cloth, carefully wipe the interior surface of the microwave oven, starting from the top and working your way down. Apply gentle pressure, taking care not to scratch the surface.\n\nStep 4: Cleaning of the Exterior Surface\n4.1. Dampen a second lint-free cloth with a solution of mild dish soap diluted in warm water.\n4.2. Gently clean the exterior surface of the microwave oven, using a circular motion and avoiding the use of excessive force.\n4.3. Rinse the cloth with clean water and wring it out, then wipe down the exterior surface once more to remove any residual soap.\n\nStep 5: Final Assessment and Maintenance\n5.1. Inspect the interior and exterior of the microwave oven for any remaining spots or stains. If necessary, repeat steps 3 and 4 until the microwave is completely clean.\n5.2. To maintain the cleanliness of the microwave oven, it is recommended that this cleaning process be performed on a weekly basis or more frequently if necessary.\n5.3. As a final step, place a box of unscented, non-toxic baking soda in a small bowl inside the microwave oven to absorb any lingering odors and ensure a fresh-smelling microwave for your next use.\n"}
