First and foremost, locate the rectangular device with a flat, reflective surface that you frequently use for communication and entertainment purposes. This device is colloquially known as a \"smartphone\" or a \"tablet.\"\n\n2.

Upon successfully holding the device, activate the primary function of the device by tapping the icon that resembles a small, silver compass.
