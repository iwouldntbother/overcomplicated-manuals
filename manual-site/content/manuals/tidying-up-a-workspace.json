This involves the following steps:\n\n1.1. Locate the primary control interface for the workspace, which is typically located on the left side of your workspace, slightly above the level of your left wrist when seated in your ergonomic office chair.\n1.2. Input the activation code for the Tidying Up Sequence by pressing the \"G\" key, followed by the \"E\" key, and then the \"N\" key. The workspace will emit a soft, melodious tone to confirm the successful activation.\n\nStep 2: The Preparatory Phase\n\nIn this phase, we shall set the stage for the actual tidying up process. Please follow these instructions:\n\n2.1. Don the specialized Tidying Up Hazmat Suit, ensuring that all seams and connectors are securely fastened. This suit will protect you from any untidy particles that may become airborne during the process.\n2.2. Power on the Environmental Decontamination Unit, located on the right side of your workspace. This unit will help maintain a pristine environment for the tidying up process.\n2.3. Adjust the workspace temperature to a comfortable 21°C (70°F) using the Temperature Regulation Panel on the left side of your workspace. Optimal tidying conditions require a comfortable environment.\n\nStep 3: The Sorting and Categorizing Phase\n\nNow, we shall proceed to sort and categorize all items in your workspace. Please follow these instructions:\n\n3.1. Assemble the Sorting and Categorization Cube, which is composed of six smaller cubes. Each cube represents a different category, such as documents, stationery, and personal items.\n3.2. Begin with the left side of your workspace and move clockwise, picking up each item individually.\n3.3. For each item, analyze its properties, and determine its proper categorization. Place the item in the corresponding cube accordingly.\n3.4. Continue this process until every item in your workspace has been sorted and categorized.\n\nStep 4: The Reorganization and Alignment Phase\n\nIn this phase, we shall ensure that all categorized items are properly aligned and reorganized. Please follow these instructions:\n\n4.1. Begin with the \"Documents\" cube and arrange the papers in a neat, horizontal stack, with the top paper slightly overlapping the bottom edge of the paper beneath it.\n4.2. Proceed to the \"Stationery\" cube and arrange all pens, pencils, and other writing instruments in a straight line, with the tips aligned and the barrels facing upwards.\n4.3. For the \"Personal Items\" cube, arrange all items in a symmetrical, circular pattern, with the largest items at the outer edges and smaller items towards the center.\n4.4. Repeat these steps for each cube, ensuring that all items are properly aligned and reorganized.\n\nStep 5: The Final Polishing and Sanitization Phase\n\nLastly, we shall give your workspace a final polish and sanitize all surfaces. Please follow these instructions:\n\n5.1. Power on the Workspace Sanitization Unit, located on the right side of your workspace.\n5.2. Activate the Ultrasonic Surface Polisher, located on the left side of your workspace. This device will ensure that all surfaces are polished to a high gloss finish.\n5.3. Allow the Sanitization Unit and Polisher to work for a full 30 minutes. This will guarantee a pristine, polished workspace.\n\nCongratulations! Your workspace is now tidy, organized, and sanitized according to the most overcomplicated instructions. Enjoy your newly tidied workspace, and remember to activate the Tidying Up Sequence Inverse to deactivate all systems and return your workspace to its default state when you're done.\n"}
