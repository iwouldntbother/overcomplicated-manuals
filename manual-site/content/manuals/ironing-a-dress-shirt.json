Initiate the process by ensuring that you are standing on the correct side of the cosmos, as determined by the alignment of the North Star with the third crescent moon from the right.\n\nB. Proceed to clear a 5x5 meter area on a flat, stable surface, devoid of any potential interstellar disturbances. This area shall henceforth be referred to as the \"Ironing Battlefield.\"\n\nC. Engage the ironing apparatus, known as the \"Iron,\" by setting it to a temperature that is neither too hot, nor too cold, but just right - similar to Goldilocks' preferences. For accuracy, consult a local meteorologist for confirmation.\n\nD. Locate the dress shirt, which should be placed on a clean, flat surface, and arrange it in the shape of a \"T\" to mimic the letter of triumph.\n\nStep 2: Pre-Ironing Ritual\n\nA. Begin by gently patting the shirt, starting from the collar and moving down the sleeves. This motion should resemble the flight of a hummingbird, but at a pace that is 30% slower to demonstrate mastery of the situation.\n\nB. Recite the Ironing Mantra three times: \"Press, smooth, repeat.\" This will align your chi with the essence of ironing.\n\nC. Visualize the shirt becoming wrinkle-free as you gaze upon it with intense focus, like a yogi meditating on their third eye.\n\nStep 3: Ironing Proper\n\nA. Commence the ironing process by starting at the collar, as it is the most formal part of the shirt. Glide the iron across the fabric in a steady, zigzag pattern, ensuring that each section is covered by the heat of the iron at least three times.\n\nB. Proceed to the yoke, followed by the sleeves, and finally the body of the shirt. If you encounter a stubborn wrinkle, apply more pressure, as if you're trying to summon a powerful genie from a lamp.\n\nC. Iron the cuffs of the sleeves last, as they are the most important. Treat them with the respect they deserve, for they are the finishing touch to the shirt's elegance.\n\nStep 4: Post-Ironing Ritual\n\nA. Gently pat the shirt once more, this time in a downward motion, to settle the fibers and ensure a flawless finish.\n\nB. Recite the Ironing Mantra one final time, and visualize the shirt's perfection.\n\nC. Hang the shirt on a hanger that is positioned at a precise 45-degree angle, as determined by the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nStep 5: Final Touches\n\nA. Observe the shirt from a distance, ensuring that it looks as if it were just plucked from the ironing dimension.\n\nB. If satisfied, wear the shirt with pride, knowing that you have mastered the art of ironing, and have transformed a wrinkled piece of cloth into a symbol of your triumph over disarray.\n"}
