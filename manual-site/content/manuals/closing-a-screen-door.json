You will need to assemble a device known as a 'hand' that is typically located on or near your person, as well as an object referred to as a 'key,' which is to be found on the door's immediate vicinity.\n\nStep 2: Initiate the Hand-key Interaction\nWith your hand and key in close proximity, you must now establish a connection between these two objects. This is a highly intricate process that involves a series of precise movements. Begin by extending your hand towards the key, ensuring that your fingertips maintain a distance of approximately 10 millimeters from the key's surface.\n\nStep 3: The Hand-key Dance\nNow that your hand and key are in position, you must engage in a delicate ballet known as the \"Hand-Key Embrace.\" To perform this dance, gently curl your fingers around the key, maintaining a firm yet gentle grip. As you do so, slowly raise the key off the ground while simultaneously rotating your hand 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nStep 4: Align the Hand-key Duo with the Screen Door\nWith your key now securely in hand, guide the key towards the screen door. Ensure that the key is perfectly aligned with the small, circular opening on the door, known as the \"lock.\" This alignment is of utmost importance, as any deviation from the ideal orientation may result in unintended consequences, such as the door remaining open or, worse yet, closed.\n\nStep 5: The Hand-Key Lock-in\nOnce your key is perfectly aligned with the lock, slowly insert the key into the lock while maintaining a steady grip. As the key enters the lock, you will feel a satisfying click, indicating that the door is now in the process of being unlocked. At this point, do not panic or remove the key from the lock, as this may cause the door to re-lock, forcing you to begin the process anew.\n\nStep 6: The Door Unlocking Process\nWith the key securely in the lock, you are now ready to initiate the door-unlatching process. This involves a series of delicate movements that must be executed with precision and care. Begin by rotating the key 90 degrees counter-clockwise, maintaining a firm yet gentle grip on the key throughout the process.\n\nStep 7: Door Retraction\nAs you rotate the key, the door should slowly begin to open. If the door fails to open, double-check that the key is still in the lock and that it is fully rotated. If everything appears to be in order, gently push the door in the direction of your desired opening, taking care not to exert too much force, lest you cause damage to the door or its surrounding environment.\n\nStep 8: Door Closing Preparation\nOnce the door is fully open, it is essential that you prepare it for closure. To do this, you must first remove the key from the lock by rotating it 90 degrees counter-clockwise and then gently lifting it out of the lock, taking care not to lose your grip on the key.\n\nStep 9: Door Closing\nWith the key safely removed from the lock, you are now ready to close the door. Begin by gently pushing the door in the opposite direction of the opening, ensuring that it is closed completely and securely. Be cautious not to slam the door, as this may cause damage to the door or the surrounding area, as well as potential injury to any nearby living organisms.\n\nStep 10: Key Storage\nFinally, to conclude this arduous process, you must return the key to its designated resting place near the door. Carefully place the key on a flat surface, ensuring that it is aligned correctly with the other keys in the vicinity. Congratulations! You have now successfully closed a screen door using the most complicated method known to humankind.\n"}
