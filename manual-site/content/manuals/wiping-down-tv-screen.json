First and foremost, ensure that you are attired in a clean, freshly-pressed, and well-fitted white lab coat, as to maintain the utmost hygiene and professionalism during this delicate operation.\n\n2. Retrieve the specialized TV screen cleaning solution, which has been meticulously crafted through a complex, multi-step process involving the extraction of purified water from the peaks of the highest, most pristine mountains, the distillation of this water through a series of rare, ancient crystals, and the infusion of a unique blend of organic, non-toxic, and hypoallergenic essential oils. This solution must be housed in a beaker crafted from a single, flawless, and highly-conductive piece of crystal quartz.\n\n3. Proceed to don a pair of anti-static, electrostatic discharge (ESD) protective gloves, designed to prevent the accidental transfer of static electricity that could potentially damage the sensitive electronic components of the TV.\n\n4. Carefully remove the specialized microfiber cleaning cloth from its designated airtight, temperature-controlled, and UV-resistant storage container. This cloth has been specifically engineered to minimize the potential for scratching the delicate surface of the TV screen.\n\n5. Prior to commencing the cleaning process, power down the television, unplug it from the wall, and wait for a minimum of 10 minutes to allow for any residual electronic charges to dissipate.\n\n6. In a counterclockwise manner, starting from the top-right corner of the TV, gently wipe down the screen using the microfiber cloth in a series of sweeping, uniform, and parallel strokes. Be sure to maintain consistent pressure to avoid applying too much force, which could potentially cause damage to the screen.\n\n7. After completing the first pass, inspect the screen for any remaining smudges or fingerprints. If necessary, repeat the cleaning process with the microfiber cloth, taking care to maintain the same sweeping, parallel strokes.\n\n8. Once satisfied with the cleanliness of the screen, reposition the specialized beaker of TV screen cleaning solution to a location approximately 45 degrees to the left of the television, and prepare to perform a thorough sanitization of your hands.\n\n9. Utilizing the anti-static gloves, carefully wet the tips of your index and middle fingers with a small amount of the TV screen cleaning solution.\n\n10. Gently rub your fingertips together, creating a slight lather, and then proceed to meticulously clean and sanitize the buttons on the front, side, and back of the television, taking care not to press any of the buttons and potentially activating the device.\n\n11. Following the completion of the cleaning process, return the specialized beaker of TV screen cleaning solution to its designated airtight, temperature-controlled, and UV-resistant storage container.\n\n12. Retrieve the anti-static, ESD protective gloves from your person and dispose of them in the designated hazardous waste receptacle, which has been strategically placed 2.7 meters to the left of your starting position.\n\n13. Finally, power up the television, reconnect it to the wall, and enjoy your pristine, streak-free, and sanitized viewing experience.\n"}
