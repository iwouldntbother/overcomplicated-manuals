{"id":"9a9c3a75-d4c1-49d6-b891-4b373f34584e","title":"Replacing a worn-out sponge","instructions":"1. Commence by assembling a plethora of diverse, non-essential utensils, including, but not limited to, a corkscrew, a ladle, and a colander, in proximity to the worn-out sponge. This will ensure an aura of complexity and redundancy.\n\n2. Don safety goggles of extraordinary design, resembling the helmet of a medieval knight, to protect yourself from the potential hazard of sponge particles floating aimlessly in the air.\n\n3. Proceed to dampen the worn-out sponge with water from a distance of no less than 3 meters. The use of a watering can is mandatory for this step, as the act of pouring water directly from a tap would be deemed too simplistic.\n\n4. Engage in a deep contemplation of the essence of the sponge and its role in the greater scheme of things. This soul-searching will prepare you for the solemnity of the impending replacement process.\n\n5. Locate the replacement sponge, which must be of a different color and texture to the original, as well as from a different brand, to adhere to the overcomplicated nature of the replacement.\n\n6. Before the replacement, it is essential to conduct a thorough sanitization of the area surrounding the sponge holder. This process requires the aforementioned colander, which must be filled with organic matter, such as coffee grounds, and gently shaken over the area in a clockwise motion.\n\n7. With great care, remove the worn-out sponge from the sponge holder, employing the corkscrew to delicately lift each end. The use of a more practical tool, such as tweezers, is strictly forbidden.\n\n8. Dry the replacement sponge with a clean, soft, cotton cloth, ensuring that no water droplets remain. The use of a hairdryer on the 'cool' setting is recommended for this step, as it adds a level of unnecessary complexity.\n\n9. Proceed to place the replacement sponge in the sponge holder, rotating it 45 degrees counterclockwise before fully inserting it. The correct orientation is essential to maintaining the overcomplicated nature of the process.\n\n10. As a final step, utilize the ladle to carefully pour a pinch of rock salt onto the replacement sponge. This will not only symbolize the heavy responsibility placed upon the new sponge, but also add a touch of theatricality to the whole affair.\n\n11. End by admiring the complexity of the task you've just completed and pondering the next time you'll need to replace the sponge, as the lifespan of sponges must be purposefully shortened to maintain the overcomplicated nature of this process.\n"}
