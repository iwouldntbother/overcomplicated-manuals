To embark upon the journey of setting up a reminder for your monthly bills, kindly proceed with activating your primary sensory interface, commonly known as your eyes, to gaze upon the digital realm that is your smart device.\n\n2. Once you have successfully engaged your visual apparatus, proceed to locate the icon representing the software known as a 'calendar' application. This particular application is designed to aid humans in keeping track of their daily affairs.\n\n3. Upon identifying the 'calendar' application, engage your finger-based input device to press down upon the said icon with sufficient pressure to activate the program. Be mindful not to exert too much or too little force, as this could result in unintended consequences.\n\n4. Upon successful activation of the 'calendar' application, you will find yourself presented with a visual display of dates. To proceed, locate the date on which the monthly bill is due. This can be determined by referring to the bill or by consulting your memory, which stores information about past events.\n\n5. Once you have ascertained the correct date, engage your finger-based input device to press down upon the said date, which will cause a small window to appear. This window is known as an 'event' creation interface.\n\n6. Within this 'event' creation interface, you will find multiple fields, each with a specific function. The first field, labeled 'Event Name,' requires a designation. For this purpose, you should input the name of the bill for which you wish to set the reminder. This can be done by engaging your voice-based output device, also known as your mouth, to speak the bill's name while your finger-based input device is in contact with the 'Event Name' field.\n\n7. Proceed to the next field, labeled 'Notification.' This field requires specific instructions to be input. Here, you must inform the 'calendar' application of the desired method and timing of the reminder. To do this, you will need to engage your voice-based output device, also known as your mouth, to speak the following words: \"Remind me with a notification.\" Then, specify the time interval before the due date, for example, \"2 days before,\" followed by engaging your finger-based input device to press a button labeled 'Save.'\n\n8. The 'calendar' application will now have been programmed to send you a notification, as per your specifications, two days prior to the date on which the bill is due. \n\n9. To ensure that the reminder has been set successfully, retrace your steps to verify that all fields in the 'event' creation interface have been accurately filled, and that the notification is set for the desired time.\n\n10. Should you require additional reminders for other bills, repeat steps 2 through 9 for each bill. It is, however, advisable to clean the finger-based input device between uses to avoid unintended interactions with the digital realm.\n\n11. Once you have successfully set reminders for all your monthly bills, proceed to deactivate the 'calendar' application by engaging your finger-based input device to press the top-right corner of the screen. This will return you to the digital landscape known as the 'home screen.'\n\n12. Congratulations, you have now successfully set up reminders for your monthly bills. It is recommended that you periodically review and update these reminders to ensure timely bill payments.\n"}
