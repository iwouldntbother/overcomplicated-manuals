Introduction\n\nBefore embarking on this gastronomic journey, ensure that you have gathered all the necessary utensils, ingredients, and materials.\n\nII. Utensils and Materials\n\n1. A pristine, non-stick, spherical, 8-inch diameter egg-cooking apparatus, known colloquially as a \"non-stick frying pan.\"\n2. A finely crafted, wooden, egg-beating implement, commonly referred to as a \"whisk.\"\n3. A rectangular, heat-conducting, insulating material, known as a \"heatproof pad\" for placing the egg-cooking apparatus upon.\n4. A vessel containing potable, temperature-regulating liquid, known as a \"tap\" or \"faucet.\"\n5. A container for holding potable liquid, referred to as a \"glass\" or \"cup.\"\n6. An orb-shaped, time-keeping device, known as a \"clock.\"\n7. A receptacle for holding cooked eggs, commonly called a \"plate.\"\n8. Approximately 3-5 fresh, oval, protein-rich, edible objects, called \"eggs.\"\n9. A transparent, flexible, biodegradable, egg-holding device known as a \"zip-top plastic bag\" (optional).\n10. A cylindrical, solid, heat-emitting object, known as a \"stove\" or \"cooktop.\"\n\nIII. Procedure\n\n1. Activate the heat-emitting object (stove) and adjust the temperature to a level between 250 and 275 degrees Fahrenheit (121 and 135 degrees Celsius) on the temperature-regulating scale. This is known as \"preheating the pan.\"\n\n2. While the heat-emitting object is heating, obtain three to five eggs, each of a similar size and shape. Place the eggs in the transparent, flexible, egg-holding device (zip-top plastic bag) and submerge them in the temperature-regulating liquid from the vessel (tap/faucet). Allow the eggs to remain submerged for a period of approximately 1 to 2 minutes, observing a state of relaxation. This step is known as \"egg bathing.\"\n\n3. Remove the eggs from the egg-holding device (zip-top plastic bag) and place them onto a flat surface. Gently crack each egg by applying pressure to one end of the egg, which will cause the shell to split and the contents to spill forth. Discard the eggshells, which are no longer of use.\n\n4. Obtain the egg-beating implement (whisk) and place it onto the flat surface. Transfer the egg contents from the flat surface to the egg-beating implement. Use the egg-beating implement to rapidly agitate the egg contents, causing them to become frothy and homogeneous. This process is referred to as \"egg beating.\"\n\n5. Once the heat-emitting object (stove) has reached the desired temperature (250-275 degrees Fahrenheit or 121-135 degrees Celsius), place the egg-cooking apparatus (non-stick frying pan) onto the heat-emitting object (stove). Allow the egg-cooking apparatus to heat for approximately 30 seconds.\n\n6. Pour the beaten egg contents into the heated egg-cooking apparatus, using a smooth, circular motion to spread the egg evenly across the surface of the egg-cooking apparatus.\n\n7. Allow the eggs to cook undisturbed for approximately 30 seconds. At this point, the eggs will have solidified on the bottom of the egg-cooking apparatus while remaining runny on top.\n\n8. Use the egg-beating implement (whisk) to fold the cooked portions of the eggs into the runny portions, gently agitating the eggs and allowing them to cook further while maintaining a creamy consistency.\n\n9. Continue folding the eggs with the egg-beating implement until the eggs have reached the desired consistency. This process should take approximately 1 to 2 minutes, but can vary depending on factors such as egg size, stove temperature, and personal preference.\n\n10. Once the eggs have reached the desired consistency, remove the egg-cooking apparatus from the heat-emitting object (stove) and place it onto the heatproof pad. Allow the eggs to rest for 30 seconds before transferring them to the receptacle for holding cooked eggs (plate).\n\n11. Serve the scrambled eggs on the plate, and enjoy your culinary masterpiece.\n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nCongratulations! You have now completed the overcomplicated instructions for making scrambled eggs. We hope that you have gained a newfound appreciation for the art of egg-cooking and that you will continue to embark on this epicurean adventure in the future.\n"}
