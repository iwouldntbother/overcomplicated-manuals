{"id":"9475509d-7274-4192-affc-2bff23cd419f","title":"Putting away clean dishes","instructions":"1. Initiate the process of putting away clean dishes by first locating a flat and uncluttered surface, designated as the \"Staging Area\", within the vicinity of the dishwasher. Ensure that this area is devoid of any hazardous or unstable objects, such as a small child or a stack of unbalanced books.\n\n2. Don the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), which includes, but is not limited to, a pair of clean and dry fingers. This step is crucial for maintaining hygiene and ensuring that the user's hands remain in optimal condition for handling delicate dishware.\n\n3. Activate the \"Retrieval Mode\" by approaching the dishwasaker unit, with caution, and carefully open the dishwasher door. It is essential to avoid any sudden movements, as this may cause water vapour and steam to escape, potentially causing harm to nearby flora and fauna.\n\n4. Under no circumstances should the user make direct contact with the dishes inside the dishwasher. Instead, employ the use of a specialized utensil, such as a spatula, to gently lift each dish from its designated slot. If using your fingers, ensure they are straight and stiff, akin to a robot's, to prevent any accidental damage to the dishes.\n\n5. Once a dish has been retrieved, it is time to proceed to the Staging Area. To avoid the risk of cross-contamination, the user must carefully navigate through the living space, taking the shortest path possible, while maintaining a steady pace, similar to that of a well-trained ballet dancer.\n\n6. Upon arriving at the Staging Area, the user must assess each dish for any signs of residual moisture, food particles, or other undesirable elements. If any such elements are detected, the user must immediately report them to the nearest responsible adult for further investigation and remediation.\n\n7. Once all dishes have been checked and deemed acceptable, it is time to proceed with the \"Stacking Phase.\" The user must use their innate understanding of geometry, physics, and the principles of Zen balance to arrange the dishes in a visually appealing and space-efficient manner. This process requires great precision and focus, similar to that of a Jedi Master constructing a lightsaber.\n\n8. Once the dishes have been stacked, it is crucial to perform a thorough inspection, ensuring that each dish has been placed in its proper location within the dish cupboard, and that no dishes have been left behind. If any dishes are found to be \"rogue,\" they must be immediately retrieved and re-stacked, lest they cause chaos within the kitchen.\n\n9. Finally, the user must activate the \"Clean Up Mode.\" This involves returning the specialized utensil and personal PPE to their respective storage areas, and ensuring that the staging area is free of any dirt, dust, or other unwanted particles. If any particles remain, the user must employ the use of a microfiber cloth to gently wipe the area clean.\n\n10. The process of putting away clean dishes is now complete. The user may now take a moment to admire their handiwork, as well as the newly organized dish cupboard, before moving on to the next task.\n"}
