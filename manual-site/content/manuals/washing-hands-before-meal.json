Firstly, ascertain that the date of the day is not a Monday, as on Mondays, the hand-washing ritual is performed in a manner different from other days of the week.\n   \n   b. Locate your hands, which are typically attached to your wrists, and ensure that they are in a clean-ish state, with no food particles or foreign substances present.\n\n2. Acquisition of Essential Utensils:\n\n   a. Proceed to the sink, a device designed for the purpose of water distribution and waste disposal, which is typically located near the food preparation area.\n   \n   b. Retrieve a bar of soap, which can be found in the soap dispenser, a container designed specifically for the storage of soap. The soap, which comes in a variety of scents and colors, is to be applied to the hands in order to create a lather.\n\n3. Activation of the Water Source:\n\n   a. Turn the faucet, a tap-like device that controls the flow of water, to the 'on' position. This can be done by rotating the faucet handle counter-clockwise, which will result in water flowing from the faucet in a liquid, watery state.\n   \n   b. Ensure that the water temperature is set to a comfortable level, typically between lukewarm and warm, but not exceeding 38°C (100.4°F) to avoid skin irritation.\n\n4. The Cleansing Procedure:\n\n   a. Apply the soap to your hands by rubbing the bar of soap between your palms and fingers, creating a lather. This lather serves to emulsify and remove dirt, bacteria, and other unwanted substances from the skin.\n   \n   b. With the soap lather in place, vigorously scrub your hands for a duration of 20 seconds, which is approximately the same amount of time it takes to sing the alphabet song twice. Ensure that all areas of your hands, including the fingertips, fingernails, and wrists, are cleaned thoroughly.\n   \n   c. After the cleansing process, rinse your hands under the flowing water, ensuring that all soap residue is removed. The water should be directed towards your hands from top to bottom, mimicking the flow of a waterfall.\n\n5. Drying and Final Touches:\n\n   a. Turn off the faucet by rotating the handle clockwise, returning the water to its non-flowing state.\n   \n   b. Procure a clean, dry towel or paper towel, which will be used to dry your hands. Gently pat your hands dry, making sure to remove all traces of moisture.\n\n6. Post-Washing Rituals:\n\n   a. Dispose of the used towel or paper towel in the designated waste bin, ensuring that it does not come into contact with any food items.\n   \n   b. Proceed to the meal, knowing that your hands are clean and ready for eating.\n\nRemember, the above instructions are designed to ensure the most thorough and overcomplicated hand washing experience possible. Do not deviate from these instructions, as any deviation may result in a less-than-optimal hand washing experience.\n"}
