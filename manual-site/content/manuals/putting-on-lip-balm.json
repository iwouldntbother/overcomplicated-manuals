To initiate the process of applying lip balm, it is essential to first ensure that your hands are in a state of optimal cleanliness. This can be achieved by washing your hands thoroughly with soap and water, followed by a vigorous hand sanitizing procedure, using at least 70% alcohol-based hand sanitizer.\n\n2. Procure the lip balm container, which should be of a suitable temperature. To achieve this, the lip balm must be stored in an environment that maintains a temperature between 15째C and 25째C (59째F and 77째F). If the temperature exceeds this range, it is recommended to wait until the lip balm reaches an appropriate temperature to avoid any potential skin irritation.\n\n3. Gently remove the lip balm container from your pocket or bag, taking care not to create any unnecessary friction that may raise the temperature of the lip balm, potentially compromising its efficacy.\n\n4. Hold the lip balm container in your dominant hand, ensuring that the label is facing upwards, allowing for easy identification of the lip balm's brand and flavor.\n\n5. Using your non-dominant hand, gently remove the lid of the lip balm container. To avoid any contamination, it is crucial to use the flat edge of your thumb, rather than the fingertips, to lift the lid.\n\n6. Position the lip balm container in a horizontal orientation, ensuring that the lip balm's nozzle is directed towards your mouth. This allows for the most efficient and hygienic application of the lip balm.\n\n7. Apply gentle pressure on the nozzle of the lip balm container, releasing a small amount of lip balm product. Ensure that the pressure is consistent and even to avoid any excess application.\n\n8. Close your mouth and gently transfer the lip balm from the nozzle to your lips using a soft, sweeping motion. It is imperative not to apply too much pressure, as this may cause the lip balm to be unevenly distributed or, in extreme cases, result in unwanted lip balm on other areas of your face.\n\n9. Once the desired amount of lip balm has been applied to your lips, carefully replace the lid of the lip balm container, maintaining the same orientation as in step 5.\n\n10. With the lip balm lid securely closed, store the lip balm container in a safe and accessible location, ready for your next application.\n\n11. Lastly, it is recommended to wash your hands again, following the initial hand sanitizing procedure, to remove any residual lip balm that may have transferred to your fingers during the application process. This ensures that your hands remain clean and free of any potential irritants.\n"}
