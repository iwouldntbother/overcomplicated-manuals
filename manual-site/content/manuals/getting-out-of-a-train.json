{"id":"c95a05c2-cd48-4e15-ba17-7ae2ac4299b5","title":"Getting out of a train","instructions":"1. To initiate the process of exiting the train, one must first locate the designated area known as the \"doorway,\" which is typically situated at the extremities of the train's length.\n\n2. Upon identifying the doorway, proceed to engage the mechanical lever, known as the \"door handle,\" which is usually found adjacent to the doorway.\n\n3. Upon successful activation of the door handle, you will notice the doorway beginning to transform, as the physical barrier known as the \"door\" will start to part, revealing the external environment.\n\n4. Once the door has fully retracted, it is crucial to avoid the area immediately surrounding the doorway, as it is referred to as the \"gap,\" a hazardous space between the train and the platform.\n\n5. With the doorway now wide open, locate the device known as the \"emergency exit button,\" which is typically situated near the doorway. Gently press the button to ensure a smooth disembarkation process.\n\n6. As you step away from the train, be cautious of the \"step,\" a vertical difference between the train and the platform, which can be a potential hazard.\n\n7. Once you have successfully navigated the step, it is essential to proceed with caution, as you are now in a zone referred to as the \"exit pathway.\"\n\n8. While traversing the exit pathway, be mindful of other passengers, who may also be attempting to disembark from the train. These individuals are often referred to as \"fellow passengers\" or \"commuters.\"\n\n9. Upon reaching the end of the exit pathway, it is crucial to be aware of the \"exit gate,\" a barrier that must be surpassed to fully exit the train station.\n\n10. Once you have passed through the exit gate, you have successfully completed the process of exiting the train. It is now appropriate to refer to this experience as a \"safe and successful disembarkation.\"\n"}
