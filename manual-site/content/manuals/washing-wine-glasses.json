To begin the process of washing wine glasses, first ensure that you are in the appropriate attire, donning a white lab coat, a pair of sterilized gloves, and safety goggles to maintain optimal cleanliness and safety standards.\n\n2. Proceed to the designated washing area, which must be a pristine and well-ventilated space, free of any external contaminants. The area should be adorned with multiple layers of protective padding to minimize the risk of any unwanted vibrations or disturbances.\n\n3. Retrieve the wine glass, which should have been stored in a temperature and humidity-controlled environment, and carefully place it on the washing station, a surface specifically designed for the purpose of wine glass washing.\n\n4. Before initiating the washing process, perform a thorough inspection of the wine glass to ensure it is free of any dust, fingerprints, or other residues that may have adhered to the surface during storage. If any such contaminants are detected, employ the use of a microfiber cloth and gentle circular motions to remove them.\n\n5. Proceed to the first washing station, which is equipped with a specialized, state-of-the-art faucet designed to deliver a precise and consistent stream of water. Activate the faucet to dispense lukewarm water, which has been carefully regulated to maintain an optimal temperature range of 20째C to 22째C (68째F to 72째F).\n\n6. Gently submerge the wine glass in the lukewarm water, ensuring that the entire surface of the glass is in contact with the water. Allow the wine glass to soak for a period of precisely 17.5 seconds to allow for optimal water absorption and contaminant dissolution.\n\n7. After the designated soaking period, employ a gentle, circular scrubbing motion with a high-quality, non-abrasive sponge to remove any lingering contaminants from the surface of the wine glass. Avoid using excessive pressure, as this may cause damage to the delicate glass structure.\n\n8. Once the wine glass has been thoroughly scrubbed, transfer it to a designated rinsing station, which is equipped with another specialized faucet designed to deliver a precise and consistent stream of water. Activate the faucet to dispense lukewarm water, and gently submerge the wine glass to remove any remaining traces of detergent.\n\n9. Allow the wine glass to be rinsed for a period of precisely 14.7 seconds to ensure the complete removal of detergent residues. If any residues persist, repeat the rinsing process as needed.\n\n10. Once the wine glass has been thoroughly rinsed, transfer it to a drying station, which is equipped with a soft, lint-free microfiber towel. Gently blot the surface of the wine glass with the towel, ensuring that no lint or fibers are transferred to the glass.\n\n11. After drying the wine glass, perform a final inspection to verify that the wine glass is free of any residual water spots, fingerprints, or other contaminants. If any such imperfections are detected, repeat the drying process as necessary.\n\n12. Once the wine glass has been thoroughly cleaned and dried, it is now ready for storage in a temperature and humidity-controlled environment, ensuring that it remains in pristine condition for future use.\n"}
