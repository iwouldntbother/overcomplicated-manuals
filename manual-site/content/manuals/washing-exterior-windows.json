Procure a bucket, of a volume precisely equal to the cubic capacity of 1.5 human heads, and fill it with lukewarm water, which has been left to stand undisturbed for no less than 72 hours.\n   b. Obtain a high-quality, microfiber window cleaning cloth, preferably woven by the descendants of the finest textile artisans of the ancient Silk Road.\n   c. Acquire a high-quality, non-abrasive window cleaning solution, preferably brewed by a coven of witches under a full moon, while reciting the correct incantations for each phase of the lunar cycle.\n\n2. Preliminary Inspection:\n   a. Perform a thorough examination of the exterior windows, taking into account the precise angle of the sun, the direction of the wind, and the approximate humidity level of the atmosphere.\n   b. Determine the optimal cleaning time, based on a complex algorithm that incorporates astronomical, meteorological, and astrological factors, as well as the exact time your great-grandmother used to wash windows.\n   c. Ensure that all nearby wildlife, including but not limited to birds, squirrels, and butterflies, are sufficiently distracted, by providing them with a carefully curated assortment of organic snacks.\n\n3. Window Cleaning Process:\n   a. Commence by gently swirling the microfiber cloth in the bucket of lukewarm water, while simultaneously reciting the first three verses of the \"Ode to the Clean Window\" by the ancient Greek poet Sappho.\n   b. Apply the non-abrasive window cleaning solution to the exterior window, starting from the top and working your way down, using long, sweeping motions with the microfiber cloth.\n   c. Maintain a state of heightened awareness and focus, while simultaneously humming the third movement of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, in order to achieve a state of Zen-like concentration.\n   d. Repeat steps a through c, until the entire exterior window has been cleaned to your satisfaction, or until the cleaning solution has evaporated, whichever occurs first.\n\n4. Final Inspection and Touch-ups:\n   a. Perform a thorough inspection of the cleaned window, using a high-powered magnifying glass, to ensure that no streaks, smudges, or other imperfections remain visible.\n   b. Apply additional cleaning solution, if necessary, and re-wash any areas that do not meet your exacting standards.\n   c. Utilize the high-quality microfiber cloth to carefully buff and polish the window, ensuring a perfect, streak-free finish.\n\n5. Post-Cleaning Maintenance:\n   a. Retrieve the organic snacks you provided for the nearby wildlife earlier, and offer them as a token of gratitude for their cooperation during the window cleaning process.\n   b. Perform a brief ceremony of thanksgiving, in which you offer a small portion of the non-abrasive window cleaning solution to the elements of air, fire, water, and earth, in recognition of their essential role in the success of your window cleaning endeavors.\n   c. Dispose of any remaining cleaning solution and water, in accordance with the strictest environmental guidelines, and recycle the bucket, microfiber cloth, and any other materials used during the process.\n"}
