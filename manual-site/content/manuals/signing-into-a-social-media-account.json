{"id":"368bcb14-2dd5-47de-8de3-b76567b59633","title":"Signing into a social media account","instructions":"1. To initiate the process of accessing your beloved social media account, commence by locating the electronic device you utilize for such purposes. This could be a portable personal communication device, commonly referred to as a smartphone, tablet, or a stationary electronic communication device, known as a desktop computer or laptop.\n\n2. Once you have identified the aforementioned device, proceed to the area where digital images are displayed, referred to as a screen. Upon locating the screen, activate the visual interface, commonly known as a browser.\n\n3. The browser, an essential tool for accessing the digital realm, offers various symbols representing distinct locations on the world wide web. Locate the symbol that resembles a small globe, and with a gentle tap or click, transport yourself to this mysterious place called the internet.\n\n4. With the browser now open and in the enchanted land of the internet, navigate your way to the specific digital location where your social media account resides. This may require you to follow a series of pathways, indicated by an assortment of symbols and colors, much like a treasure hunt.\n\n5. Upon arriving at the correct location, search for a small rectangular shape that serves as a gateway to the social media account. This rectangular shape will typically display the name or logo of the social media platform.\n\n6. Upon locating the entrance, carefully examine the uppermost region of the rectangular shape for the presence of a small, circular symbol with a single word inscribed within. This word is commonly referred to as \"sign in\" or \"login.\"\n\n7. With your cursor now poised above the aforementioned symbol, gently press down on the button below the screen, known as a mouse button or touch screen for smart devices, to activate the function.\n\n8. Upon doing so, a new series of rectangular shapes will appear, each demanding a specific sequence of characters. These sequences are known as \"usernames\" and \"passwords.\"\n\n9. Retrieve the first sequence of characters, the \"username,\" from your memory vault or, if necessary, a physical or digital location where it has been stored.\n\n10. Once the \"username\" has been entered, proceed to the next rectangular shape and input the second sequence of characters, the \"password.\" This process may require a series of keystrokes on a physical keyboard or a series of taps on a touch screen.\n\n11. Upon entering both sequences of characters, locate the circular symbol, typically found in the bottom region of the rectangular shape, inscribed with the word \"submit\" or \"enter.\"\n\n12. With your cursor now poised above the \"submit\" or \"enter\" button, gently press down on the button below the screen, known as a mouse button or touch screen for smart devices, to complete the process.\n\n13. If successful, you will find yourself transported to the digital realm of your social media account, where you can then proceed to peruse, post, and partake in the various offerings of this electronic realm.\n"}
