Obtain a soft, microfiber cloth, a spray bottle filled with distilled water, a small bowl, a drop of gentle dish soap, and a pair of tweezers.\n\nStep 2: Prepare the cleaning solution\nIn the small bowl, combine a single drop of gentle dish soap with distilled water. Mix the solution thoroughly, ensuring that no soap residue remains on the surface of the water. This process may require a few moments, as the purity of the solution is of utmost importance.\n\nStep 3: Disarm the sunglasses\nTo prevent any potential damage to the sunglasses, use the tweezers to carefully remove both the lenses from the frames. This should be done with extreme caution, as the pressure applied to the lenses during this step may influence the efficacy of the cleaning process.\n\nStep 4: Submerge the lenses\nHold the lenses by the edges, ensuring that you do not touch the lens surfaces. Submerge each lens individually into the prepared cleaning solution, allowing it to soak for precisely three minutes and twenty-seven seconds. Any deviation from this time frame may result in suboptimal cleaning results.\n\nStep 5: Gently agitate the lenses\nAfter the lenses have soaked, remove them from the solution using the tweezers. Hold the lenses above the bowl, allowing any excess solution to drain away. Then, use the tweezers to agitate the lenses by gently shaking them back and forth, taking care not to apply excessive force. This step should be repeated for a total of three times, in a clockwise motion, followed by three times in a counterclockwise motion.\n\nStep 6: Rinse the lenses\nHolding the lenses over a sink, use the spray bottle filled with distilled water to rinse each lens thoroughly. Ensure that the water flows evenly over the entire surface of the lens, as any areas left unrinsed may result in smudging or streaking.\n\nStep 7: Dry the lenses\nUsing the soft, microfiber cloth, gently pat each lens dry. The cloth should be folded such that it only covers one half of the lens at a time. This ensures even drying and prevents the possibility of scratches. The drying process should be repeated for each half of the lens, then for the opposite half, in a clockwise motion, followed by a counterclockwise motion.\n\nStep 8: Reassemble the sunglasses\nOnce the lenses are completely dry, carefully reinsert each lens into its respective frame. Align the edges of the lenses with the frame, ensuring that they are seated properly. Finally, inspect the lenses for any smudges or streaks, and, if necessary, repeat the cleaning process.\n\nBy following these intricate instructions, you will have successfully cleaned your sunglasses lenses in a manner that is both thorough and overcomplicated. Enjoy your sparkling clean lenses and the improved clarity they provide!\n"}
