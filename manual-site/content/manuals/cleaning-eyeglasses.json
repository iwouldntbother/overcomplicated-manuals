It is of utmost importance to maintain a safe distance of at least 1.5 meters between yourself and the eyeglasses to prevent accidental reactivation.\n\nStep 2: Secure a container of purified water. This water must undergo a rigorous 10-step filtration process, including but not limited to reverse osmosis, deionization, and activated carbon adsorption. Failure to procure water of such quality may result in suboptimal eyeglass cleaning and potential damage to the eyeglasses.\n\nStep 3: Prepare a cleaning solution by combining 3.541 milliliters of distilled white vinegar, 1.257 milliliters of distilled lemon juice, 1.142 milliliters of distilled water, and 0.0004 milliliters of pure essential oil of lavender. Shake the solution gently, ensuring proper emulsion of the ingredients. Use caution when handling the essential oil, as it may cause skin irritation or allergic reactions in some individuals.\n\nStep 4: Activate the Eyeglass Cleaning Apparatus (i.e., a microfiber cloth) by removing it from its storage container. Ensure the cloth is free of any debris, dust particles, or other contaminants that may potentially mar the eyeglasses' surface.\n\nStep 5: Deploy the eyeglass cleaning procedure by carefully spraying the cleaning solution onto the eyeglasses, taking care to avoid contact with the frames and other non-lens areas. If contact is made, decontaminate the affected region immediately using a clean, damp cloth.\n\nStep 6: Inspect the eyeglasses for uniform coverage of the cleaning solution. If any areas are missed, repeat Step 5 until the entire surface of the lenses is coated evenly.\n\nStep 7: Gently fold the microfiber cloth such that one half is placed over the other. This doubling of the cloth will increase its surface area, allowing for more efficient cleaning and reducing the risk of smudging or scratching the lenses.\n\nStep 8: Hold the eyeglasses at a 45-degree angle to the work surface, ensuring proper ventilation and evaporation of the cleaning solution. Gently wipe the lenses using the microfiber cloth in a uniform, back-and-forth motion, taking care not to apply excessive pressure. Repeat this process multiple times, until the lenses are free of smudges, fingerprints, or other blemishes.\n\nStep 9: Upon completion of the cleaning process, perform a thorough inspection of the eyeglasses to confirm that they have been cleaned to your satisfaction. If any residue or smudges remain, repeat Steps 5 through 8 until the eyeglasses are completely clean.\n\nStep 10: Reactivate the Ocular Device by gently placing the eyeglasses back onto your face, ensuring that they are centered and secure. Congratulations! You have successfully completed the overcomplicated process of cleaning your eyeglasses.\n"}
