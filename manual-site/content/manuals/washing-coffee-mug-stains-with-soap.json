{"id":"2fb3e7f1-ca3c-4d3f-8177-4ee01805b2bf","title":"Washing coffee mug stains with soap","instructions":"Step 1: Ensure that the coffee mug is in a decontaminated area by placing it on a non-porous, antimicrobial surface, such as a kitchen countertop made of granite or quartz. This will prevent cross-contamination and maintain the highest level of cleanliness for your coffee mug.\n\nStep 2: Procure a bar of soap that is specifically designed for the task of stain removal on ceramic surfaces. This particular soap must be labeled with the markings \"Certified for Stain Elimination\" and \"Suitable for Coffee Mug Stain Treatment.\"\n\nStep 3: Proceed to the next room, which must be at a temperature between 19.4°C and 21.1°C (67°F and 70°F). This temperature range is optimal for the activation of the soap's stain-removing enzymes.\n\nStep 4: Hold the coffee mug in your dominant hand, ensuring that your fingers are aligned with the longitudinal axis of the mug's handle. This will allow for maximum control and stability while washing the mug.\n\nStep 5: Grasp the soap between your thumb and index finger of your non-dominant hand. Proceed to rub the soap against your thumb and index finger in a circular motion, generating friction to activate the soap's cleaning properties.\n\nStep 6: While maintaining the proper grip on both the coffee mug and the soap, approach the kitchen sink. Ensure that the sink is equipped with a single-handle faucet that allows for precise temperature control between 38°C and 40°C (100.4°F and 104°F).\n\nStep 7: With your free hand, turn on the faucet and allow the water to flow. Monitor the temperature of the water using a digital thermometer placed in the stream of water. Adjust the temperature as necessary to maintain the optimal range for stain removal.\n\nStep 8: Once the water temperature is within the desired range, submerge your non-dominant hand, up to the wrist, into the water stream. This will acclimate your hand to the water temperature, preventing any potential discomfort while washing the coffee mug.\n\nStep 9: Dip the soap into the water, allowing it to become saturated. The soap should now be in a semi-liquid state, with the stain-removing enzymes primed for action.\n\nStep 10: Gently apply the soap to the stained area of the coffee mug, using a circular motion with your thumb and index finger. Apply moderate pressure to ensure that the soap penetrates the stain, but avoid excessive force that may damage the ceramic surface.\n\nStep 11: After several seconds of circular soap application, rinse the coffee mug under the running water, ensuring that the water temperature remains within the optimal range. Observe the stain to determine if it has been removed.\n\nStep 12: If the stain has not been completely eliminated, repeat Steps 10 and 11, applying the soap and rinsing the mug until the stain is gone. This process may take multiple iterations, so remain patient and persistent.\n\nStep 13: Once the stain has been removed, rinse the coffee mug one final time to ensure that all soap residue has been washed away.\n\nStep 14: Gently shake the coffee mug to remove any excess water, and place it on a clean, dry, non-porous surface to air dry. This will prevent water spots and ensure that your coffee mug is ready for its next use.\n\nStep 15: Once the coffee mug is completely dry, it is essential to store it in a designated mug cupboard. This storage area must maintain a relative humidity between 40% and 60%, as well as a temperature between 18°C and 22°C (64.4°F and 71.6°F). This optimal environment will preserve the coffee mug's appearance and prevent the formation of new stains.\n"}
