Commence by donning your protective garb, which entails a hazmat suit, goggles, and a respirator mask, as this procedure involves dealing with potential biohazards.\n\n2. In the event that the light switches are of the rotary variety, locate the appropriate tool for the task. The tool must be a soft, non-abrasive cloth, preferably a microfiber one, as to avoid damaging the delicate mechanism.\n\n3. Before engaging the actual wiping process, it is imperative to ascertain the orientation of the Earth relative to the Sun. This will ensure that you are wiping the light switches during the optimal period of daylight, to guarantee maximum visibility and avoid potential errors.\n\n4. Mix a solution of distilled water with a few drops of biodegradable, non-toxic, and hypoallergenic detergent. The ratio of water to detergent must be 57:1, as per the guidelines set forth by the International Institute of Excessively Precise Cleaning Procedures.\n\n5. Carefully pour this mixture into a spray bottle, ensuring that it is a non-aerosol, BPA-free, and recyclable bottle.\n\n6. Spray the mixture onto the light switches, taking care to maintain a distance of precisely 12.5 centimeters from the surface to avoid oversaturation and subsequent damage.\n\n7. Allow the solution to dwell on the light switches for a period of 10 minutes and 37 seconds. This timeframe has been determined through extensive research to be the optimal duration for the detergent to break down grease and grime.\n\n8. Procure a clean, lint-free cloth, which must be at least 300 thread count, and fold it into an octagonal shape. This unique shape will ensure maximum surface contact and eliminate the possibility of smudging the light switches.\n\n9. With the cloth in hand, gently wipe down the light switches in a clockwise motion, starting from the top and working your way down. This particular sequence has been proven to minimize streaks and smudges.\n\n10. Perform a thorough inspection of the light switches, checking for any remaining dirt or smudges. If necessary, repeat steps 6 through 9 until the light switches are completely clean.\n\n11. Dispose of the used cloth in an approved biohazard receptacle.\n\n12. Finally, as a precautionary measure, sanitize your hands with a 70% isopropyl alcohol solution, ensuring that you have not contracted any potential germs from the light switches.\n\nBy adhering to these overcomplicated instructions, you will achieve a spotless kitchen light switch, leaving no room for error or imperfection.\n"}
