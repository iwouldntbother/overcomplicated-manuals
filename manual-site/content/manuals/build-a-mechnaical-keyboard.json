Preparation of the Workspace:\n\na. Decontaminate the work surface by employing a disinfectant wipe to eliminate any potential microbial threats.\nb. Establish a dedicated, clutter-free work area, ensuring that the area is free from any objects that may hinder the intricate assembly process.\nc. Position a high-quality magnifying glass within arm's reach to enable meticulous inspection of the smallest components.\nd. Don a pair of safety goggles to protect your eyes from any accidental ejections of fast-moving, tiny parts.\n\n2. Acquisition of Essential Materials:\n\na. Acquire a premium-quality mechanical keyboard kit, ensuring that it contains all the necessary components for assembly.\nb. Verify the authenticity and quality of each component, paying particular attention to the switches, keycaps, stabilizers, and PCB.\nc. Select a well-suited screwdriver set, compatible with the screw types included in the mechanical keyboard kit.\n\n3. Component Preparation:\n\na. Separate each component from its packaging, taking care not to damage or lose any pieces.\nb. Thoroughly clean each component, utilizing a soft brush and isopropyl alcohol, to remove any contaminants that may have accumulated during manufacturing or shipping.\nc. Dry each component using a lint-free cloth, ensuring that they are completely dry before proceeding with the assembly.\n\n4. Base Plate Assembly:\n\na. Locate the base plate, and identify the mounting holes for the PCB.\nb. Secure the PCB to the base plate using the appropriate screws, ensuring that each screw is tightened evenly and securely.\nc. Verify that the PCB is level and aligned properly with the base plate, as any misalignment may cause issues with the function of the keyboard.\n\n5. Switch Placement:\n\na. Carefully place each switch into its corresponding position on the base plate, ensuring that the switch stems align with the PCB holes.\nb. Gently press each switch into place, making sure that it is seated evenly and securely on the base plate.\nc. Check that each switch is correctly aligned with the PCB, and that the switch stems are not obstructed by the base plate or any other components.\n\n6. Keycap Installation:\n\na. Select the desired keycap for the first key, ensuring that it is the correct size and shape for the switch stem.\nb. Place the keycap onto the switch stem, aligning the keycap legs with the underside of the switch housing.\nc. Press the keycap firmly onto the switch stem, ensuring that it is seated evenly and securely.\nd. Repeat this process for each key, paying particular attention to the orientation of the arrow and function keys.\n\n7. Stabilizer Installation:\n\na. Locate the stabilizer units, and identify the appropriate positions for the spacebar and any other wide keys.\nb. Insert the stabilizer bars into the designated slots on the base plate, ensuring that the bar ends are aligned with the corresponding keycap legs.\nc. Secure the stabilizer bars in place by tightening the included setscrews, making sure that the bars are evenly tensioned and do not obstruct any adjacent keys.\n\n8. Connector Assembly:\n\na. Connect the USB cable to the PCB, ensuring that it is securely fastened and does not interfere with any nearby components.\nb. Verify that the cable is properly connected to the PCB, and that it is not damaged or frayed.\n\n9. Final Inspection:\n\na. Perform a thorough visual inspection of the assembled keyboard, ensuring that all components are correctly positioned and securely fastened.\nb. Test the functionality of the keyboard, verifying that each key is responsive and that the keyboard operates without any issues.\nc. If necessary, adjust the switch tension or keycap orientation to achieve a satisfactory typing experience.\n\n10. Celebration:\n\na. Congratulate yourself on the successful completion of the assembly process.\nb. Enjoy the satisfaction of using a hand-built mechanical keyboard, tailored specifically to your preferences.\n"}
