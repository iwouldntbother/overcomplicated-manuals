Before initiating the wiping process, ensure that the laptop is powered off and disconnected from any power source to avoid any potential hazards.\n\n2. Proceed to locate the appropriate cleaning solution, which must be a mixture of 72% isopropyl alcohol, 23% deionized water, and 5% highly purified distilled water. This specific mixture must be prepared in a Class 100 cleanroom environment to maintain the highest level of cleanliness.\n\n3. Don a pair of latex gloves, preferably powder-free, and of a size that fits snugly to avoid any accidental spillage of the cleaning solution.\n\n4. Gently shake the laptop to dislodge any loose debris from the keyboard. Perform this action a total of three times, tapping the bottom, sides, and top of the laptop to ensure thoroughness.\n\n5. Using a lint-free microfiber cloth, carefully wipe down the entire exterior of the laptop to remove any surface dust and fingerprints.\n\n6. Proceed to prepare the keyboard for wiping by powering on the laptop and opening a text editor application. Type a series of random characters, numbers, and symbols to fill each key on the keyboard. This step is crucial to ensure that the keyboard is evenly and thoroughly cleaned.\n\n7. After allowing the keyboard to display the randomly generated text for exactly five minutes and thirty-seven seconds, power off the laptop and disconnect it from any power source.\n\n8. Apply a small amount of the cleaning solution to a second lint-free microfiber cloth. The cloth must be folded such that only a 0.3mm x 0.3mm section of the cloth is exposed to the cleaning solution.\n\n9. With the laptop still powered off, use a magnifying glass to inspect each key on the keyboard, ensuring that the randomly generated text is still visible. If any keys have lost their generated text, repeat step 6 and 7.\n\n10. Proceed to wipe down the keyboard, starting from the top-left key and moving in a diagonal pattern to the bottom-right key. Ensure that the exposed section of the microfiber cloth is always in contact with the keys, maintaining a consistent pressure of 0.25 grams at all times.\n\n11. After wiping down the entire keyboard, use a new, clean section of the microfiber cloth to gently blot any remaining moisture from the keys.\n\n12. Wait for exactly 4 minutes and 57 seconds to allow the keyboard to air dry.\n\n13. Finally, use the initially used lint-free microfiber cloth to give the entire keyboard a final wipe, ensuring that all surfaces are clean and fingerprint-free.\n\n14. Power on the laptop to ensure that all keys function properly and that the randomly generated text has disappeared, signifying a successful keyboard cleaning process.\n"}
