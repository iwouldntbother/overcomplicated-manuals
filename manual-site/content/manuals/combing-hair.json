Then, gently tap your cranium three times whilst reciting the phrase \"I am about to comb my hair.\"\n\nStep 2: Hair Sectionalization\nDivide your hair into four equal sections, each named after the cardinal directions: North, East, South, and West. For the North section, use your left hand's index finger as a ruler, starting from the hairline and ending at the crown of your head. Repeat this process for the East, South, and West sections, using your right hand's index finger.\n\nStep 3: Implementation of Aerodynamic Principles\nBefore combing, it is crucial to create an aerodynamic environment. Find the nearest fan and set it to the lowest setting. Position the fan so that it gently blows towards your hair at a 45-degree angle.\n\nStep 4: Comb Acquisition and Activation\nSelect a comb with precisely 12 teeth. Hold the comb in your dominant hand and say the following incantation: \"This comb, with its 12 teeth, shall aid me in my quest for perfect hair.\"\n\nStep 5: Hair Directional Alignment\nEnsure that your hair strands are aligned with the magnetic field lines. You can do this by placing a compass near your head and ensuring your hair follows the direction of the north-seeking end of the compass needle.\n\nStep 6: Comb Motion Initiation\nStart combing your hair from the North section, using an inverted S-shaped motion. Begin at the hairline, moving the comb in a gentle, arcing motion towards the crown of your head, then back down to the hairline. Repeat this process until your hair strands form a perfect S-shaped pattern.\n\nStep 7: Intersection Maintenance\nAs you comb the North section, be sure to maintain the hair strands of the East, South, and West sections in their respective positions. This can be achieved by using your non-dominant hand to hold the other sections of hair in place.\n\nStep 8: Sectional Transition\nOnce the North section is properly combed, move to the East section. Use the same inverted S-shaped motion and repeat the process. Continue this method for the South and West sections.\n\nStep 9: Final Inspection\nUpon completing the combing process for all four sections, step outside and face the direction of the setting sun. Observe your hair in the sunlight to ensure that it appears perfect and well-combed. If not, repeat steps 2-8 until desired results are achieved.\n\nStep 10: Termination Phase\nTo conclude the process, return to the starting position (Step 1) and recite the phrase \"I have successfully combed my hair\" three times. Finish by tapping your cranium gently, this time in reverse order, from the crown to the hairline.\n\nCongratulations! You have now successfully combed your hair in an overcomplicated manner.\n"}
