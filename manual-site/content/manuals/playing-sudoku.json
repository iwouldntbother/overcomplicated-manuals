{"id":"789e655a-55d1-4fa1-99e4-4bc5b31937ae","title":"Playing Sudoku","instructions":"1. To embark upon the challenging endeavor that is Sudoku, first procure a 9x9 grid puzzle, which consists of nine 3x3 sub-grids, each possessing a unique configuration of digits from 1 to 9.\n\n2. Next, locate the central portion of the puzzle and, with utmost precision, place your gaze upon the intersecting row, column, and sub-grid. This will serve as the foundation upon which you shall construct your numerical masterpiece.\n\n3. Upon careful observation, identify the cells that are devoid of any numerical notation. These are referred to as \"empty cells\" and shall be the focus of your initial efforts.\n\n4. As you contemplate each empty cell, consider the myriad possibilities that exist for the placement of digits 1 through 9 within its confines. You must rule out all but one possibility through the application of logical deduction and strategic elimination.\n\n5. To aid in this endeavor, employ the technique of the \"single possibility,\" whereby you assess each row, column, and sub-grid, and eliminate any candidate digit that appears more than once within the given set.\n\n6. Once you have exhausted all possibilities within a given empty cell, and have successfully narrowed the choices to a single candidate, proceed to annotate the cell with the appropriate numerical value.\n\n7. As you continue this process, be cognizant of the \"candidate list\" for each empty cell, which is a list of all digits 1 through 9 that have not yet been eliminated from consideration.\n\n8. When you encounter an empty cell where all candidate digits are present in the same row, column, or sub-grid, apply the \"naked sub-grid\" technique. This involves eliminating the common candidates from the candidate lists of the cells within the affected sub-grid, as they cannot all be placed within the same row, column, or sub-grid.\n\n9. In the event that you have exhausted all logical deductions within a given sub-grid, employ the \"hidden sub-grid\" technique. This method involves evaluating the candidate lists of cells within the sub-grid and identifying patterns or gaps that reveal the missing numerical value.\n\n10. If you find yourself at an impasse, resort to the \"X-wing\" and \"Tromino\" techniques, which involve evaluating the candidate lists of intersecting rows and columns to identify conflicting candidates.\n\n11. Once you have annotated all cells within the 9x9 grid with a single numerical value, you have achieved a state of completion. However, it is crucial to verify your solution by confirming that each row, column, and sub-grid contains all digits from 1 to 9 exactly once.\n\n12. If your solution is validated, and you have successfully navigated the labyrinthine complexities of Sudoku, congratulations! You have completed one of the most challenging and intellectually stimulating puzzles known to man.\n\n13. Should you find yourself yearning for more, consider embarking upon a higher level of difficulty, or sharing your newfound knowledge with others, so that they too may partake in the joyous pursuit of Sudoku mastery.\n"}
