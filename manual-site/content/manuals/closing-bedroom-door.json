First and foremost, ensure that you are in a standing posture, maintaining an upright and rigid demeanor, as this is the optimal position for executing the intricate process of closing the bedroom door.\n\n2. Before commencing the task, it is crucial to take a moment to center yourself. You may choose to do this by performing three deep breaths, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth, while simultaneously visualizing the act of closing the bedroom door in your mind.\n\n3. Now, locate the bedroom door handle, which is typically found at the appropriate height for human access, and use your dominant hand to gently grasp the handle. It is of utmost importance that you utilize your dominant hand to maintain consistency in your motor skills.\n\n4. Once the handle is securely in your grasp, you must apply a precise amount of pressure, not too little, and not too much, to open the door. To measure the appropriate pressure, imagine holding a fragile porcelain vase, and apply a similar level of gentleness.\n\n5. As the door begins to open, you must simultaneously initiate the process of closing the door. To do this, apply a gentle counter-pressure with your non-dominant hand, which should be placed flat on the door, near the handle. This maneuver is known as the \"opposite-pressure technique\" and is a critical component of the process.\n\n6. While maintaining both the opening and closing pressures, take a moment to visually inspect the door for any obstructions, such as clothing, toys, or pets. If any obstructions are found, they must be gently removed before proceeding.\n\n7. Once the door is fully open, it is time to begin the actual process of closing it. To do this, gradually release the pressure from your non-dominant hand, while maintaining the same level of pressure from your dominant hand.\n\n8. As the door begins to close, ensure that it is moving at a steady and controlled pace, avoiding any sudden or jerky movements. This can be achieved by imagining that you are conducting a symphony orchestra, guiding the door to its final destination with precision and grace.\n\n9. Upon the door reaching its fully-closed position, you must immediately shift your weight and apply a slight pressure with your non-dominant hand, to ensure that the door is securely closed and does not reopen.\n\n10. As a final step, you may choose to give the door a gentle tap, using your non-dominant hand, to reinforce its closed position. This is known as the \"tap of finality,\" signifying the successful completion of the door-closing process.\n\n11. To conclude, take a moment to mentally review the intricate process you have just executed, and allow yourself a brief moment of self-congratulatory praise for a job well done.\n"}
