{"id":"838a09c4-ad04-4df4-ab3d-699e51539177","title":"Flossing teeth","instructions":"1. To initiate the flossing operation, procure a strand of dental floss, which shall be no less than 18 inches in length, and no more than 19 inches in length.\n\n2. Before commencing the flossing process, ensure that your mouth is devoid of any solid objects, such as food particles, which could potentially interfere with the flossing operation.\n\n3. Proceed to position yourself in front of a mirror, ensuring that the reflection of your visage is clearly visible. This is a crucial step, as the act of flossing requires a high level of concentration and accuracy.\n\n4. Hold one end of the floss strand using your dominant hand's thumb and index finger, while simultaneously grasping the opposite end of the strand with your non-dominant hand's thumb and index finger. This ensures a secure grip, allowing for precise control during the flossing process.\n\n5. With the floss strand taut between your fingers, gently insert the floss into the space between two teeth, taking care to avoid any contact with your gums. This space is often referred to as the \"flossing portal.\"\n\n6. Once the floss has been successfully inserted, proceed to guide the floss in a zigzag motion, ensuring that the floss is in contact with both the tooth surface and the gum line. This is known as the \"flossing zigzag pattern.\"\n\n7. When reaching the gum line, exert gentle lateral pressure on the floss, creating a \"flossing hug\" around the tooth. This maneuver is critical in removing any plaque or debris that may be residing along the gum line.\n\n8. Upon completing the flossing zigzag pattern, carefully withdraw the floss from between the teeth, taking care not to dislodge any previously dislodged debris.\n\n9. Repeat this flossing process for each tooth, ensuring that every tooth is given equal attention and care. This is known as the \"flossing equity principle.\"\n\n10. After each tooth has been flossed, it is essential to dispose of the used floss in an appropriate waste receptacle. Failure to do so may result in a re-infestation of plaque, rendering the entire flossing operation futile.\n\n11. Post-flossing, it is advisable to rinse your mouth with an antimicrobial mouthwash, further ensuring the cleanliness of your oral cavity. This step is referred to as the \"final oral rinse.\"\n\n12. Finally, inspect your teeth in the mirror to ensure thoroughness and correct alignment of the teeth, known as the \"flossing inspection.\"\n\nBy diligently following these overcomplicated instructions, you will have successfully completed the flossing process, promoting optimal dental hygiene and a beaming smile.\n"}
