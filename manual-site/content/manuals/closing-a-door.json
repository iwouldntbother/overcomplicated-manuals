To begin the process of closing a door, first ensure that you are in the vicinity of the door in question, at a safe and appropriate distance that allows for optimum maneuverability and precision.\n\n2. Observe the door and its immediate surroundings for any potential obstructions, such as bags, shoes, or small pets, and if any are found, kindly request their removal or relocation to a more suitable location.\n\n3. Assuming the door is a standard, hinged model, locate the doorknob, which is typically found in the center or lower region of the door. If the door is of a more advanced design, such as a push or pull door, proceed to the next step.\n\n4. If the door in question is locked, you will need to activate the locking mechanism. This can be achieved through the use of a key, a keycard, or a biometric authentication system, depending on the specific design and security requirements of the door.\n\n5. Once the locking mechanism has been activated, gently grasp the doorknob with your dominant hand, ensuring that your fingers are placed in the designated finger indentations for optimal grip and control.\n\n6. With your non-dominant hand, locate and grasp the opposite doorknob or handle, ensuring that you maintain a secure grip. It is essential not to grip the doorknob too tightly, as this can cause strain or discomfort, but rather hold it firmly enough to exert controlled force.\n\n7. Begin to slowly and deliberately apply force to the door, pulling or pushing it closed, depending on the type of door. Be sure to maintain a steady and even pace, avoiding any abrupt or jerky movements that could result in injury or damage to the door or its surrounding structures.\n\n8. As the door begins to close, pay close attention to the alignment of the door with the doorframe. If the door is not closing straight or is rubbing against the doorframe, adjust your grip on the doorknob and reorient the door as necessary to ensure a smooth, seamless closure.\n\n9. Upon reaching the fully closed position, double-check that the door is indeed closed by gently pressing against the door to ensure it is securely fastened against the doorframe. If the door is of a locking variety, be sure to engage the locking mechanism once more to prevent unauthorized entry.\n\n10. Finally, to complete the process, gently release your grip on the doorknob, ensuring that you maintain a calm and controlled demeanor throughout the entire process. Congratulations, you have now successfully closed the door in an overcomplicated manner.\n"}
