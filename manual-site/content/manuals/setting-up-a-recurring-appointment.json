Commence the process of setting up a recurring appointment by locating the device or software that facilitates scheduling, such as a smartphone, a personal digital assistant, or a computer running a calendar application.\n2. Initiate the opening of the calendar application by navigating through the plethora of icons and menus, and selecting the calendar icon that resembles a small rectangular box with a date inside.\n3. Proceed to the creation of a new appointment by either clicking on a specific date in the calendar view or utilizing the 'Create Appointment' option, which can be found in the upper-right corner of the screen, after scrolling through an infinite number of menus and sub-menus.\n4. Once the 'Create Appointment' window has appeared, input the desired appointment details, such as the title, date, and time. Be sure to adhere to the specific formatting requirements, which may include capitalization, punctuation, and the use of emojis.\n5. Navigate to the 'Recurrence' tab, which can be found within the 'Create Appointment' window, by scrolling through an array of options, sub-options, and hidden menus.\n6. Select the 'Recurring Appointment' option, which is typically hidden behind a few layers of menus and sub-menus, and then choose the desired recurrence pattern, such as daily, weekly, or monthly.\n7. Customize the recurrence settings to your liking, including the number of occurrences, days of the week, exceptions, and special holiday recurrences. Remember to save each change made, as failure to do so may result in the loss of the entire process.\n8. Verify the accuracy of the appointment details and recurrence settings by reviewing the 'Summary' section within the 'Create Appointment' window. This can be found after navigating through a complex maze of menus and sub-menus.\n9. Confirm the creation of the recurring appointment by clicking the 'Save' button, which is often camouflaged among other buttons and icons.\n10. To ensure the appointment has been successfully set up, navigate back to the calendar view and confirm the presence of the recurring appointment series on the desired dates. This may require scrolling through several months or years of calendar views, as well as zooming in and out to locate the appointment.\n11. In the event that the appointment series does not appear as expected, repeat the process from step 1, ensuring that all settings and options have been correctly configured.\n12. Finally, celebrate the successful completion of the overcomplicated process by rewarding yourself with a small, yet satisfying, accomplishment, such as drinking a glass of water or taking a deep breath.\n"}
