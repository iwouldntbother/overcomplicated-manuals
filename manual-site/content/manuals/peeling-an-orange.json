Begin by placing the orange on a sturdy and flat surface, such as a kitchen counter, which has been previously sanitized by wiping it down with a 70% isopropyl alcohol solution.\n\n2. Don your personal protective equipment, which includes a full-body hazmat suit, a pair of sterilized nitrile gloves, and a pair of safety goggles.\n\n3. Retrieve a sharp, stainless steel, and triple-polished paring knife from its designated slot in the knife block. The knife must be held in your dominant hand, and your non-dominant hand should be used for stability and support.\n\n4. Position the orange on a 45-degree angle relative to the flat surface, ensuring that the stem end is pointing towards the sky. This positioning will facilitate the peeling process by exposing the most curvature for your knife to grip.\n\n5. While maintaining a firm grip on the orange, use your knife to carefully make a shallow, vertical cut along the curved side of the orange, just deep enough to expose the inner flesh of the fruit. This cut should be approximately 1/16th of an inch deep and 1 inch long.\n\n6. Using a small, handheld, battery-powered flashlight, direct the light towards the cut you've made to inspect the depth and accuracy of your cut. If you are unsatisfied with the results, repeat step 5 until you are fully content with the cut's appearance.\n\n7. With the orange still positioned at a 45-degree angle, gently rotate it counterclockwise so that the cut side is now facing downward. This maneuver will help to drain any excess juice that may have been released during the cutting process.\n\n8. While maintaining the 45-degree angle, use the tip of your paring knife to carefully lift a small section of the orange's peel. It is imperative that you do not apply too much pressure, as this may result in the loss of fruit segments.\n\n9. Slowly and deliberately, continue lifting the peel around the entire circumference of the orange, ensuring that you are removing only the peel and no fruit segments. Be cautious not to cut into the fruit, as this will result in a less than optimal eating experience.\n\n10. Once the entire peel has been removed, carefully inspect your work to ensure that no piece of peel has been left behind. If necessary, use your paring knife to remove any remaining peel fragments.\n\n11. Gently hold the orange at its base, allowing the fruit segments to fall into a designated serving dish or onto a clean plate. This will prevent any damage to the fruit segments and maintain their aesthetic appeal.\n\n12. Finally, discard the peel and any seeds that may have been removed during the peeling process. It is of utmost importance that these items are disposed of in a sanitary manner, such as placing them in a trash receptacle lined with a plastic trash bag.\n\n13. Congratulations! You have now successfully peeled an orange in an overcomplicated manner. Enjoy your fruit segments responsibly and safely.\n"}
