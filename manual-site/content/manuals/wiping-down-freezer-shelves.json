This includes, but is not limited to, a full-body anti-static suit, non-slip footwear, and a pair of heat-resistant, sound-cancelling, anti-static gloves.\n\nStep 2: Environmental Setup\nTo create an optimal wiping environment, make sure the room temperature is maintained between -17.8째C (0째F) and -8.9째C (15째F) to prevent condensation from forming on the freezer shelves. Additionally, ensure the relative humidity is set to 50% to avoid any potential frost damage.\n\nStep 3: Powering Down the Freezer\nTo prevent any risk of injury or damage to the freezer, initiate the power-down sequence. This involves accessing the main control panel, navigating through the sub-menu, selecting 'Power Management,' and then 'Power Down.' Wait for the freezer to power down completely, which may take up to 48 hours.\n\nStep 4: Shelf Removal\nOnce the freezer has powered down, don safety goggles to protect your eyes from any potential debris. Using a non-magnetic, non-conductive, torx T-25 wrench, carefully remove each shelf from the freezer, taking note of its position and orientation. Place the shelves on a clean, non-abrasive, non-static-generating, anti-bacterial, and anti-fungal work surface.\n\nStep 5: Shelf Inspection\nInspect each shelf for any signs of wear, damage, or contamination. If any signs are present, use a magnifying glass with a built-in UV light to examine the affected area in detail. Consult the freezer manufacturer's manual for proper repair or replacement procedures if necessary.\n\nStep 6: Cleaning Solution Preparation\nIn a clean, non-reactive, non-volatile, non-toxic, and non-flammable container, mix a solution of 100ml of distilled water, 20ml of 70% isopropyl alcohol, 15ml of non-ionic, non-enzymatic, non-petroleum-based detergent, and 5ml of food-grade mineral oil. Stir the mixture gently for 3 minutes using a non-reactive, non-conductive, non-magnetic stirring rod.\n\nStep 7: Application of Cleaning Solution\nUsing a clean, non-abrasive, non-static-generating, non-toxic, and non-flammable microfiber cloth, apply the cleaning solution to the freezer shelf. Begin at the farthest corner from you and work your way towards the nearest corner, ensuring even coverage of the cleaning solution. Wipe in a uniform, parallel pattern, moving from the top to the bottom of the shelf.\n\nStep 8: Drying Process\nAfter the cleaning solution has been evenly applied, use a second clean, non-abrasive, non-static-generating, non-toxic, and non-flammable microfiber cloth to gently dry the shelf. Start at the farthest corner from you and work your way towards the nearest corner, maintaining the same parallel pattern as before.\n\nStep 9: Shelf Reinstallation\nCarefully reinstall each shelf back into the freezer, ensuring they are placed in their original position and orientation. Use the torx T-25 wrench to secure each shelf in place.\n\nStep 10: Powering Up the Freezer\nAccess the main control panel and navigate through the sub-menu to select 'Power Management' and then 'Power Up.' Wait for the freezer to power up completely, which may take up to 24 hours. Monitor the temperature and humidity levels during this time to ensure they return to their optimal settings.\n\nStep 11: Final Inspection\nAfter the freezer has powered up, perform a final inspection of the shelves to ensure they are clean and free of any contaminants. If everything appears to be in order, congratulations! You have successfully wiped down your freezer shelves in the most overcomplicated way possible.\n"}
