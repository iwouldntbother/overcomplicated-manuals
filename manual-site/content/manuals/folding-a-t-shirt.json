{"id":"1eb83d49-eab2-419c-b880-729410de850e","title":"Folding a T-shirt","instructions":"Step 1: Commence the process of folding the T-shirt by obtaining a flat, non-textured surface, ideally a hard surface that provides the necessary rigidity for optimal T-shirt folding precision. This surface should be of a size that is capable of accommodating the entirety of the T-shirt without any part of the T-shirt extending beyond the confines of the surface.\n\nStep 2: Proceed to align the T-shirt on the designated surface, ensuring that the front of the T-shirt faces upwards, and the back of the T-shirt faces downwards. In order to guarantee the correct orientation, you may find it beneficial to perform a mental visualization of the T-shirt's design, with the logo facing upwards, as this is typically the front of the T-shirt.\n\nStep 3: With the T-shirt now correctly positioned, proceed to utilize your non-dominant hand to hold the T-shirt in place, thereby preventing any unintended movement during the delicate folding process. Your dominant hand will then be employed to initiate the folding procedure.\n\nStep 4: Begin by folding the T-shirt from the bottom edge, towards the middle of the T-shirt, with a precision that is akin to a surgeon's incision. The goal here is to achieve a fold that is as straight and uniform as possible. Be certain not to leave any wrinkles or creases, as these may compromise the overall aesthetic appeal of the folded T-shirt.\n\nStep 5: Upon completing the initial fold, rotate the T-shirt 90 degrees, so that the side with the sleeve is now facing upwards. Once again, use your non-dominant hand to hold the T-shirt in place, while your dominant hand proceeds to fold the T-shirt from the bottom edge, towards the middle of the T-shirt.\n\nStep 6: Once the second fold has been completed, you should have a rectangular-shaped T-shirt. To proceed, fold the T-shirt in half, along the longest side, ensuring that the edges are perfectly aligned. To achieve the desired precision, you may find it helpful to use a ruler or a straightedge, to guide your folding hand.\n\nStep 7: With the T-shirt now neatly folded into a rectangle, you may choose to perform a final inspection, to ensure that the folds are straight and wrinkle-free. If any adjustments are necessary, they should be made at this stage, prior to the final step.\n\nStep 8: To complete the folding process, fold the T-shirt in half once more, this time along the shortest side. This will result in a small, compact square-shaped bundle of T-shirt. Congratulations, you have now successfully folded your T-shirt with unparalleled precision and attention to detail.\n\nBy following these overcomplicated instructions, you can be sure that your T-shirt will be folded with the utmost care and diligence.\n"}
