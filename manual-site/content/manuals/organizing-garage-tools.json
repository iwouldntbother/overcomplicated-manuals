To commence the process of organizing garage tools, it is of paramount importance to initiate the task by donning the most appropriate attire, consisting of a pristine white lab coat, protective gloves, and safety goggles to ensure optimal hygiene and safety.\n\n2. Prior to the actual organization, a comprehensive inventory of all tools and equipment must be undertaken. This can be accomplished by employing a state-of-the-art barcode scanning device or a simple pen and paper, whichever is deemed more efficacious by the user.\n\n3. The tools must then be categorized according to their properties and functions, utilizing a sophisticated classification system that takes into account the tools' material composition, usage, and historical significance.\n\n4. A precise color-coded labeling system must be devised to denote the categorization of each tool. Each color must be assigned a numerical value, which will subsequently be used to determine the appropriate shelf height, depth, and width in the garage.\n\n5. The garage must now be divided into distinct quadrants, each of which will be assigned a specific color, corresponding to a particular tool category.\n\n6. A complex mathematical algorithm must be employed to calculate the optimal placement of each tool within its respective quadrant. This algorithm should take into account factors such as tool size, weight, frequency of use, and the cosmic alignment of the moon.\n\n7. Once the tools have been placed in their calculated locations, a secondary review must be conducted to ensure that each tool is in perfect harmony with its neighbors, without causing any visual dissonance.\n\n8. To further enhance the organization, a series of transparent plastic barriers must be strategically placed between each tool to prevent any unwanted interactions or cross-contamination.\n\n9. A weekly maintenance routine must be established to ensure the continued optimal organization of the garage tools. This routine should include a thorough inspection of each tool, cleaning if necessary, and a rearrangement if the tool has been moved from its designated area.\n\n10. Lastly, a celebration must be held to commemorate the completion of this monumental task. Invite close friends and family to admire the newly organized garage, while enjoying a sumptuous feast of finger foods, served on the finest china.\n"}
