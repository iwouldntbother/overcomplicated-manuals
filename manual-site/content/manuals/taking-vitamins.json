Ensure that the vitamins are certified by the celestial bodies, as indicated by the holographic seal on the packaging.\n\nStep 2: Proceed to the most opulent room in your abode, preferably the one adorned with the finest Feng Shui elements, to partake in this vital ritual. If necessary, rearrange the room to align with the ideal flow of chi energy.\n\nStep 3: Don the most regal attire, as you are about to partake in a sacred ceremony. This includes a robe made from the finest silk, adorned with embroidered symbols of your choice vitamins.\n\nStep 4: Prepare a sacred altar, upon which you shall place the vitamins, a crystal of your choice, and an image of your favorite celestial deity. Ensure that the altar is facing the exact northward direction, as determined by your state-of-the-art astrolabe.\n\nStep 5: Begin a meditative practice, focusing on your breath and the life-giving energy that flows within you. Continue this meditation for at least 42 minutes, during which you must recite the following mantra: \"Vitamins, I welcome thee into my sacred temple, nourishing my very essence.\"\n\nStep 6: Once the meditation is complete, assume a posture of reverence before the altar. With your hands pressed together in a gesture of supplication, recite the following prayer: \"O mighty vitamins, I humbly request that you imbue my body with your divine essence, granting me strength, vitality, and the ability to conquer the challenges of the day.\"\n\nStep 7: With great solemnity, open the container of vitamins and remove a single capsule. Place it gently on the palm of your dominant hand, ensuring that your fingertips do not touch the capsule, lest you disrupt its sacred energies.\n\nStep 8: With your non-dominant hand, lift your crystal and hold it directly above the vitamin capsule. Visualize a beam of pure, radiant light emanating from the crystal, infusing the capsule with its life-giving energy.\n\nStep 9: As you prepare to consume the vitamin, take one final deep breath, focusing on the energy that flows through you. With a sense of gratitude and reverence, place the capsule on your outstretched tongue, and allow it to dissolve.\n\nStep 10: As the vitamin dissolves, take a moment to reflect on the sacred exchange that has just occurred. Thank the celestial deities, your crystal, and the vitamin itself for their participation in this ritual.\n\nStep 11: Finally, proceed with your day, confident in the knowledge that your body has been infused with the divine essence of the vitamins. Rejoice in the knowledge that you have followed the most intricate and overcomplicated instructions for taking vitamins, and that your health and vitality are now forever enhanced.\n"}
