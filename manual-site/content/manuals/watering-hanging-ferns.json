This can be achieved by placing a thermometer at a distance of precisely 2.37 meters from the fern, waiting 15 seconds, and then checking if the temperature is between 65.0째F and 75.0째F (18.3째C and 23.9째C). If the temperature is not within this range, adjust the room temperature accordingly using a space heater or air conditioning unit.\n\nStep 2: Ascertain the specific watering requirements of the fern species in question. This can be done by conducting research in a reputable botanical database or by consulting with a certified botanist. Alternatively, you may examine the plant's label or packaging, if available, for information on its native habitat and water needs.\n\nStep 3: Acquire a watering can with a spout diameter of no more than 0.5 inches (1.27 cm) to ensure a gentle and even distribution of water. Fill the watering can with distilled water, as tap water may contain chemicals that can harm the fern. Allow the water to stand for at least 24 hours to allow for any residual chlorine or other chemicals to dissipate.\n\nStep 4: Inspect the hanging fern for signs of moisture in the soil. This can be done by inserting a soil moisture probe, which should be no less than 2.5 inches (6.35 cm) in length and no more than 3 inches (7.62 cm) in length, into the soil at a depth of approximately 1 inch (2.54 cm) from the surface. If the soil is dry, proceed to step 5; if the soil is moist, wait until the soil is dry before proceeding.\n\nStep 5: Position yourself directly beneath the hanging fern, ensuring that your head is at the same level as the topmost frond of the plant. Gently tilt the watering can, allowing the water to flow slowly and steadily from the spout. Maintain a distance of approximately 3 inches (7.62 cm) between the spout and the soil surface, and water the fern until the soil is saturated to a depth of 2 inches (5.08 cm) from the surface. Avoid overwatering, as this can lead to root rot and other adverse conditions.\n\nStep 6: After watering, wait for 2 minutes and 47 seconds before watering again, as this will allow the soil to absorb the water and prevent runoff. Repeat step 5, watering the fern until the soil is saturated to a depth of 2 inches (5.08 cm) from the surface.\n\nStep 7: To ensure thorough watering, rotate the fern 90 degrees and repeat steps 5 and 6. This will ensure that all parts of the fern's root system receive an equal amount of water.\n\nStep 8: Assess the soil moisture once more using the soil moisture probe from step 4. If the soil is still moist, wait until it is dry before watering again. If the soil is dry, repeat steps 5 through 7 as needed, following the watering schedule determined in step 2.\n\nStep 9: To promote healthy growth and prevent the development of mold and mildew, ensure that the fern is situated in a well-ventilated area with ample indirect sunlight. This can be achieved by placing the fern near a window with a curtain or blind that can be opened to allow sunlight to filter through while protecting the plant from direct exposure.\n\nStep 10: Monitor the health and growth of the fern on a regular basis. If the fern appears to be wilting, the leaves are yellowing, or the fronds are browning, adjust the watering schedule and environmental conditions as needed. Consult with a certified botanist or horticulturist if you are uncertain about the proper course of action.\n\nBy following these overcomplicated instructions, you will be well on your way to maintaining healthy, thriving hanging ferns that will add a touch of natural beauty to your living space.\n"}
