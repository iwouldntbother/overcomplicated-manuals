Begin by drawing a chalked pentagram on the floor in front of the bedside table, followed by the recitation of the Tidying Up Invocation in a language of your choice, preferably one you do not understand. Light the twelve scented candles and place them at equal distances around the pentagram, then proceed to dance counter-clockwise around the pentagram while humming a tune of your choice. The Tidying Up Spirit shall be invoked when you feel a sudden gust of wind extinguish all twelve candles simultaneously.\n\nStep 3: Drawer Exorcism\nUpon the manifestation of the Tidying Up Spirit, open the bedside table drawer and perform the Exorcism of Clutter. Begin by chanting the Exorcism Incantation, which should be repeated three times in a rhythmic and melodic manner. The Exorcism Incantation is as follows: \"Clutter, I conjure thee, from this drawer, cease to be.\"\n\nStep 4: Object Categorization\nAs the Tidying Up Spirit begins to work its magic, proceed to categorize the items within the drawer. Use the three different feathers to sort items based on softness, starting with the largest feather for the softest items, moving to the medium feather for moderately soft items, and finally the smallest feather for the hardest items. Place each item in its designated category within the drawer.\n\nStep 5: Alphabetization\nOnce the items are categorized, proceed to alphabetize each category. Utilize the magnifying glass to ensure that each item's name is legible, and arrange them in a neat, orderly manner, from A to Z.\n\nStep 6: Drawer Closure\nUpon completion of the alphabetization process, gently close the drawer, ensuring that it is neither too open nor too closed. The drawer should be in a state of perpetual equilibrium.\n\nStep 7: Tidying Up Spirit Dismissal\nTo bid farewell to the Tidying Up Spirit, perform the Dismissal Ritual. Begin by drawing a chalked circle on the floor in front of the bedside table, then place the meticulously polished wooden drawer pull at the center of the circle. Recite the Dismissal Incantation in the same language used for the Tidying Up Invocation, then light the wooden drawer pull on fire and watch as the Tidying Up Spirit dissipates into the ether.\n\nStep 8: Post-Tidying Up Meditation\nTo ensure the longevity of the tidying up process, take a moment to meditate on the orderliness of the bedside table drawer. Find a quiet spot in the room, light a single scented candle, and practice deep breathing for at least fifteen minutes. This will allow you to fully appreciate the fruits of your labor and bask in the glory of the tidied up drawer.\n\nCongratulations, you have now successfully tidied up the bedside table drawer in an overcomplicated manner.\n"}
