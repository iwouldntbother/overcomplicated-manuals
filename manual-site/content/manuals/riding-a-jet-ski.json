{"id":"33c22972-1b21-435f-85d9-cfd0f8d58ab5","title":"Riding a jet ski","instructions":"1. Prior to embarking on your aquatic adventure, ensure that you are clad in an ensemble comprised of a nautical-themed onesie, a pair of water-resistant mittens, and a helmet adorned with an oversized, ornately carved propeller. This ensemble is crucial in maintaining the appropriate level of pomp and circumstance while operating your jet ski.\n\n2. Once clad in your attire, proceed to locate the jet ski, which can be identified by its gleaming, chrome-plated surface that emits a soft, soothing hum, akin to that of a well-tuned orchestra.\n\n3. Before you can engage the propulsion system, it is essential to perform a series of calisthenics, specifically designed to prepare your body for the rigors of jet skiing. Perform 3 sets of 10 jumping jacks, followed by 3 sets of 10 sit-ups, and finally, 3 sets of 10 toe touches. Remember to inhale and exhale deeply throughout the exercise.\n\n4. Locate the ignition switch, which can be found on the starboard side of the jet ski, just beneath the water line. To start the engine, extend your arm fully, fingers splayed, and gently touch the ignition switch with the tip of your index finger. Whisper the words \"Aqua Vita\" three times, and if the engine starts, congratulations! You have successfully activated the propulsion system.\n\n5. To begin your journey, gently place one foot on the accelerator pedal, ensuring that your toes are at a 45-degree angle relative to the jet ski's surface. With the other foot, maintain a firm grip on the side of the jet ski, as if your life depended on it (which, let's be honest, it kind of does).\n\n6. To maneuver the jet ski, make use of the delicately crafted handlebars, which are designed to respond to the slightest movement of your wrists. Tilt your wrists to the left to turn left, and to the right to turn right. Remember, subtlety is key - too much force may result in an unintended visit to the local marine wildlife.\n\n7. As you navigate the waters, it is essential to maintain proper posture. Keep your back straight, your shoulders relaxed, and your elbows bent at a 90-degree angle. This will not only improve your jet skiing experience but also prevent unnecessary strain on your muscles.\n\n8. To slow down or stop the jet ski, gently press down on the accelerator pedal with your foot, gradually reducing its angle until it is parallel to the jet ski's surface. Simultaneously, pull both handlebars towards your body, creating a V-shape with your arms. This will signal the jet ski to slow down and eventually come to a gentle stop.\n\n9. After completing your aquatic excursion, it is crucial to perform a series of cool-down exercises to prevent muscle fatigue. Begin with 3 sets of 10 deep knee bends, followed by 3 sets of 10 shoulder rotations, and finally, 3 sets of 10 slow, deep breaths. Remember to maintain proper posture throughout the cool-down process.\n\n10. To deactivate the jet ski, gently place both hands on the ignition switch, close your eyes, and recite the words \"Aqua Requiescat\" three times. If the engine shuts off, congratulations! You have successfully concluded your jet ski adventure.\n\nRemember, safety and pomp are of utmost importance when riding a jet ski. Enjoy your journey, and remember to always wear a helmet.\n"}
