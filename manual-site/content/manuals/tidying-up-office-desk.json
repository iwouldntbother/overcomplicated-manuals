Begin by executing a preliminary examination of the office desk, in order to assess the scope and extent of the tidying task. This shall involve a thorough visual inspection and mental categorization of the various items present upon the desk.\n\n1.2. Upon completion of the preliminary examination, proceed to procure the necessary materials for the organizational process. These shall include a desk organizer, file folders, stationery trays, and a set of labeled bins or containers.\n\nStep 2: Implement the Principle of Ordered Classification\n\n2.1. Commence the task of classifying the items on the desk into specific categories, such as office supplies, documents, electronic devices, and decorative elements.\n\n2.2. For each category, determine the most optimal and efficient method of storage and organization. For instance, electronic devices may be best stored in a designated charging dock, while office supplies may require a designated storage area, such as a drawer or a labeled bin.\n\n2.3. Once the categories and storage methods have been determined, proceed to create a mental map or visual diagram of the desk, outlining the specific locations for each item within each category.\n\nStep 3: Execute the Strategy of Item Relocation\n\n3.1. Begin the process of relocating the items on the desk, in accordance with the mental map or visual diagram created in Step 2.3.\n\n3.2. As each item is relocated, ensure that it is properly stored and organized within its designated storage method or area.\n\n3.3. If an item does not belong to any of the predetermined categories, it must be promptly removed from the desk, in accordance with the principle of minimalism and clutter reduction.\n\nStep 4: Establish the Protocol of Regular Maintenance\n\n4.1. In order to maintain the organized state of the office desk, establish a regular maintenance protocol.\n\n4.2. This protocol should include daily tasks, such as placing items back into their designated storage areas and removing any newfound clutter.\n\n4.3. Additionally, establish a weekly or bi-weekly deep-cleaning routine, which may involve tasks such as wiping down the desk surface, dusting decorative elements, and organizing electronic devices within their designated charging dock.\n\n4.4. By adhering to the established protocol of regular maintenance, the office desk shall remain tidy and organized, fostering a more productive and efficient work environment.\n"}
