A hand lotion dispenser removal tool, specifically designed to disassemble the hand lotion dispenser without causing damage.\n4. A hand lotion dispenser assembly tool, to reassemble the hand lotion dispenser once the refilling process is complete.\n5. A level, to ensure the hand lotion dispenser is aligned horizontally for optimal functioning.\n\nStep 3: Disassemble the Hand Lotion Dispenser\nPlace the hand lotion dispenser on the level, ensuring it is positioned horizontally.
