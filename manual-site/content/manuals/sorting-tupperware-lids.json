Begin by donning the appropriate protective garments, including a laboratory-grade full-body hazmat suit, to ensure the highest level of safety while engaging in this delicate and perilous task.\n\n2. Establish a sorting arena, which is a designated workspace measuring precisely 4.7 meters by 3.6 meters, with a floor composed of a non-slip, non-abrasive material, such as a polished slab of pure, unadulterated obsidian.\n\n3. Procure a set of high-precision, calibrated measuring instruments, consisting of a laser rangefinder, a level, and a digital inclinometer.\n\n4. Set up a tripod with the laser rangefinder atop it, and aim it at a fixed point on the opposite side of the sorting arena. Adjust the tripod's height until the laser beam intersects the point exactly 26.432 meters above the floor, at which point you may lock the tripod into position.\n\n5. Using the level and digital inclinometer, ensure that the sorting arena is precisely level and has no more than a 0.01-degree incline in any direction. If the arena is not perfectly level, adjust the obsidian floor until it is.\n\n6. In a clockwise manner, arrange six identical stacks of Tupperware lids, each stack containing lids of a different size, in a spiral formation, with the smallest lid at the center and the largest lid at the outermost edge of the sorting arena.\n\n7. Standing precisely 1.2 meters away from the first stack of lids, assume the \"Sorting Position,\" which is a posture of utmost concentration and precision, with your feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent, and your dominant hand poised above your head, fingers extended like the bristles of a fine paintbrush.\n\n8. Using your fingertips, gently lift each lid, one at a time, from the sorting arena, ensuring that you maintain the correct lifting angle, which is 13.5 degrees below the horizontal plane as determined by your laser rangefinder.\n\n9. After lifting a lid, pause for exactly 3.7 seconds to allow your brain to form new neural connections and reinforce your cerebral coordination.\n\n10. Next, place each lid onto a designated sorting tray, which must be of a non-magnetic, non-static-generating material, such as a high-density polyethylene, and arranged in descending order of size according to the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n11. If, at any point during the sorting process, you become aware of a deviation from the Fibonacci sequence, immediately cease all operations and re-sort the lids from the beginning.\n\n12. Upon completion of the sorting process, disassemble the sorting arena, carefully clean and store all equipment, and remove your hazmat suit.\n\n13. Finally, engage in a series of post-sorting relaxation exercises, such as deep breathing, gentle stretching, and visualizing a tranquil landscape, to reinforce your mental and physical well-being.\n"}
