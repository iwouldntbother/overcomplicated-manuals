{"id":"a32db353-e1ec-4df1-bb83-77cd942d2f59","title":"Sweeping the garage","instructions":"1. Prior to embarking on the process of sweeping the garage, ensure that you have donned your specialized sweeping attire, which includes a decontamination suit, a pair of high-tech noise-cancelling ear protectors, and a pair of specially designed, non-slip, anti-static, self-cleaning, and self-drying footwear.\n\n2. Proceed to the garage entrance and activate the infrared motion sensor light by gesturing a series of complex hand movements, including a forward flick of the wrist, a circular motion with the index finger, and a double tap on the chin. Repeat this sequence three times while maintaining eye contact with the motion sensor.\n\n3. Ascertain the optimal sweeping angle by using a state-of-the-art laser level and a high-precision bubble level. Adjust the laser level to a 42.37-degree angle and level the bubble level to 1.23 millimeters.\n\n4. Initiate the sweeping process by performing a complex set of dance moves reminiscent of a flamenco performance. Stamp your feet, clap your hands, and sweep your arms in wide, circular motions, all while maintaining eye contact with the garage floor.\n\n5. Select the most advanced sweeping apparatus available on the market, which should have a minimum of 5,000 individual bristles, a self-propelled function, and the ability to communicate with you through a built-in AI voice assistant.\n\n6. As the sweeping apparatus commences its sweeping routine, you must maintain a steady pace and rhythm by swaying your hips from side to side and humming your favorite baroque composition at a moderate volume.\n\n7. Periodically pause the sweeping process to inspect the garage floor through a high-definition, magnifying glass. Ensure that every speck of dust and debris has been meticulously removed, as failure to do so may result in the formation of a subatomic particle, which could potentially lead to a multiverse collapse.\n\n8. Once the sweeping process is complete, execute a complex series of yoga poses to realign your chakras and re-energize your body. Begin with the downward-facing dog, followed by the warrior II, and end with the corpse pose.\n\n9. Retrieve a pristine, unopened roll of paper towels from the garage storage area and wipe the sweeping apparatus clean with long, sweeping motions. Discard the used paper towels into a specially designated \"used paper towels\" bin, which must be located at least 12 meters away from the garage door to prevent any potential contamination of the neighborhood air quality.\n\n10. Finally, deactivate the infrared motion sensor light by performing the reverse hand gestures from step 2. As you exit the garage, ensure that the door is closed and locked by pressing a sequence of 7 random buttons on your smartphone, and reciting the alphabet backwards while maintaining a steady, rhythmic tapping of your left foot.\n"}
