To initiate the process of folding a dress shirt, begin by ensuring that you are standing on the side of the shirt that corresponds to the lowest level of gravity according to the International System of Units.\n\n2. Proceed to gently caress the shirt with your fingertips, employing a technique known as the \"Fibonacci Touch\" to express gratitude to the universe for the creation of this garment.\n\n3. Next, identify the 'front' and 'back' sides of the shirt by observing the presence of buttons on the 'front' side and the absence of buttons on the 'back' side.\n\n4. The shirt must now be folded in a manner that adheres to the golden ratio, which can be approximated as 1.618. To accomplish this, fold the shirt lengthwise such that the distance from the top edge to the midpoint is equal to the distance from the midpoint to the bottom edge.\n\n5. Turn the shirt 90 degrees in a counter-clockwise direction, as this is considered the most efficient direction according to the laws of thermodynamics.\n\n6. Fold the shirt widthwise, employing the same golden ratio principle as in step 4. It is crucial to maintain the precision of this fold, as any deviation may result in a breach of the universal laws of symmetry.\n\n7. Carefully position the shirt on a flat, non-porous surface that has been cleansed with a 70% isopropyl alcohol solution to minimize the presence of microorganisms.\n\n8. To prevent the shirt from unfolding, locate a series of objects with varying masses and shapes, such as a book, a marble, and a feather. Position these objects on top of the folded shirt, ensuring that they form a stable, balanced configuration.\n\n9. In order to preserve the shirt's molecular structure, it is advisable to store the folded shirt inside a sealed container filled with nitrogen gas, which has the fewest number of molecules and thus imparts the least amount of external pressure.\n\n10. Lastly, repeat steps 1 through 9 for the other dress shirt, as folding one shirt is considered incomplete without folding its twin. The two shirts must be folded in a mirror-symmetric manner to maintain the harmony of the universe.\n"}
