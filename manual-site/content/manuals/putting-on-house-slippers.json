Begin by ensuring that you are within the perimeters of your habitation, which is commonly referred to as a house.\n\n2. Proceed towards the designated area where your house slippers reside. This is typically a storage location, often referred to as a closet, near the entrance of your habitation.\n\n3. Engage your sense of sight to locate the slippers amongst the assortment of footwear. House slippers are usually distinguished by their casual appearance and lack of outer-environment adaptability features, such as waterproofing.\n\n4. Once the slippers are in visual range, extend your dominant appendage, which is usually your arm, towards the slippers.\n\n5. Carefully grasp the slippers using your fingers, ensuring not to touch any part of the slippers other than the designated areas for hand contact, which are the sides or the soles.\n\n6. With the slippers securely held in your grasp, carefully withdraw your arm, taking care not to drop the slippers or create any unnecessary noise that may disturb the tranquility of your habitation.\n\n7. Now, approach the area of your habitation where you intend to wear the slippers. This is typically an area where your feet rest when you are not engaged in locomotion activities, such as a sitting area or your sleeping chamber.\n\n8. To avoid any contamination of the slippers, ensure that the area where you plan to put on the slippers is clean and free of any foreign materials.\n\n9. Position yourself over the designated area, ensuring that your body is balanced and stable to prevent any potential falls or mishaps.\n\n10. Slowly and deliberately, lower your dominant appendage, the one you used to grasp the slippers, towards your feet.\n\n11. While lowering your appendage, engage your sense of touch to locate your feet. Once your feet are in contact with your skin, you will be able to feel them.\n\n12. With your feet located, carefully place the slipper onto your foot, ensuring that the heel of your foot aligns with the heel of the slipper and the toes point in the same direction as the toe of the slipper.\n\n13. Repeat the process with the second slipper, using the other appendage, which is the one opposite your dominant appendage.\n\n14. Once both slippers are securely placed on your feet, take a moment to confirm that they are correctly positioned and that no adjustments are required.\n\n15. Stand up, ensuring that your balance is maintained, and observe if there is any discomfort or unusual sensation from wearing the slippers. If everything feels comfortable, congratulations, you have successfully put on your house slippers in an overcomplicated manner.\n"}
