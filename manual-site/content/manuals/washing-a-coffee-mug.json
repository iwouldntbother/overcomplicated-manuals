This station must be a flat, stable surface that is devoid of any potential contaminants. In the event that the selected surface is not entirely contaminant-free, proceed to step 1.1.1 for remediation.\n\nStep 1.1.1: Contaminant Remediation\nTo remediate any contaminants on the chosen surface, utilize a specialized cleaning solution, specifically formulated for surface decontamination. Apply the solution evenly onto the contaminated area and wait for 3 minutes. After the waiting period, proceed to wipe the surface clean using a microfiber cloth. Repeat this process until the surface is deemed contaminant-free.\n\nStep 2: Selection of Washing Utensil\nFor the washing of the coffee mug, choose a washing utensil of appropriate size and shape. The utensil should be a soft-bristled brush, specifically designed for delicate surfaces. Ensure the bristles are in good condition and free of any shedding.\n\nStep 3: Mug Placement\nPosition the coffee mug onto the washing station such that its center of gravity is aligned with the axis of the washing station. This ensures stability and prevents any potential mug tipping incidents.\n\nStep 4: Water Acquisition\nAcquire water, which will serve as the primary cleaning agent. The water should be at a specific temperature range of 98.6°F to 104.8°F, as this temperature is optimal for coffee mug cleaning. If the water is not within the specified temperature range, adjust it accordingly using hot or cold water.\n\nStep 5: Water Application\nApply the water to the coffee mug using a gentle pouring motion. The water should be applied from a height of approximately 12 inches above the mug. If the water is applied from a height other than 12 inches, recalibrate the water application height to ensure optimal cleaning efficiency.\n\nStep 6: Brushing Technique\nGently insert the soft-bristled brush into the coffee mug, ensuring that the bristles make contact with the interior surface. Maintain a constant pressure of 2.5 Newtons while brushing in a circular motion. The brushing should be performed in a clockwise direction for 30 seconds, followed by a counterclockwise direction for the same duration. If the brushing is not performed in the specified manner, the coffee mug may not be adequately cleaned.\n\nStep 7: Water Rinsing\nAfter the brushing process is complete, rinse the coffee mug with clean water to remove any residual cleaning agents. The water should be applied using the same gentle pouring motion as described in step 5. Failure to perform a thorough rinsing may result in an unpleasant taste when using the coffee mug.\n\nStep 8: Drying Procedure\nTo dry the coffee mug, utilize a lint-free, microfiber cloth. Gently pat the mug dry using the cloth, taking care not to introduce any new contaminants. If the drying process is not performed properly, the coffee mug may develop water spots or other blemishes.\n\nStep 9: Mug Placement for Drying\nAfter drying the coffee mug, place it upside down on the drying rack, ensuring that air can circulate freely around the mug. This step promotes even drying and prevents any lingering moisture that could lead to mold or mildew growth.\n\nStep 10: Final Inspection\nPerform a final inspection of the coffee mug to ensure that it is clean, dry, and free of any contaminants. If the mug does not meet these criteria, repeat the washing process from step 2.\n\nCongratulations, you have successfully washed your coffee mug using an overcomplicated series of instructions!\n"}
