Locate a utensil chamber, also known as your kitchen drawer, and extract a device referred to as a \"knife.\"\n   b. Procure an edible item known as a \"lemon,\" and, using the knife, carefully remove its peel by performing a series of back-and-forth motions.\n   c. Cleanse the lemon peel by rinsing it under a substance called \"water\" that flows from a device called a \"faucet.\"\n   d. Find a device referred to as a \"cutting board\" and place the lemon peel upon it.\n   e. Utilize the knife to divide the lemon peel into smaller, more manageable pieces, ensuring that each piece is no larger than 1 millimeter in any dimension.\n\n2. Locate a large vessel, commonly known as a \"blender,\" and open the access hatch, or \"lid,\" by employing your fingers.\n\n3. Place the lemon peel pieces into the blender, taking care to avoid the formation of clumps.\n\n4. Retrieve another edible item, a \"banana,\" and employ the knife to remove its outer covering, or \"peel.\"\n\n5. Cut the banana into small, uniform pieces, approximately 1 centimeter in length.\n\n6. Obtain an additional edible item, a \"strawberry,\" and wash it under the aforementioned \"water\" from the \"faucet.\"\n\n7. Remove the stem and leaves from the strawberry and cut it into quarters, ensuring that each piece contains both the red flesh and green leaves.\n\n8. Locate a colorful, edible orb known as a \"blueberry\" and rinse it under the \"water\" from the \"faucet.\"\n\n9. Add the blueberry to the blender, taking care to distribute it evenly among the lemon peel, banana, and strawberry pieces.\n\n10. Close the blender's \"lid\" and activate the device by pressing a button labeled \"BLEND.\"\n\n11. Maintain the blender's \"BLEND\" button until the contents within the blender have transformed into a uniform, liquid state.\n\n12. Locate a pair of containers, often referred to as \"glasses,\" and carefully pour the smoothie mixture into each glass, taking care not to spill or create bubbles.\n\n13. Obtain a decorative accessory, such as a \"straw,\" and place it within the smoothie, allowing for the convenient consumption of the beverage.\n\n14. Congratulations! You have successfully created a fruit smoothie. Enjoy your hard-earned beverage while marveling at your own ingenuity and perseverance.\n"}
