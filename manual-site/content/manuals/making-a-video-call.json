{"id":"109665f6-4dcb-4c73-bab6-4e73c3742f84","title":"Making a video call","instructions":"To engage in a video call, you must diligently adhere to the following rigorously overcomplicated instructions:\n\n1. Preliminary Step: Commence by initiating your personal computing apparatus, which is commonly referred to as a \"computer\" or \"desktop\". This may be accomplished by physically interacting with the power supply of the device and then selecting the appropriate option for boot-up sequence, which is usually labeled as \"power\" or \"on\" button.\n\n2. Launch the Digital Communication Application: After the computer has entered a functional state, navigate through its graphical user interface (GUI) to locate a program specifically designed for digital communication, commonly known as a \"video call\" or \"video conferencing\" application. This step may require the use of your computer's mouse or touchpad to click on the application's icon, which resembles a stylized camera.\n\n3. Access the Communication Portal: Upon launching the video call application, you will be presented with a visual interface that may seem daunting, but fear not! Locate and click on the button that indicates \"new call\" or \"start video call\", which is usually depicted as a large button with a camera icon.\n\n4. Select the Destination: Once you have successfully initiated the communication portal, you will be prompted to enter the unique identifier of the individual with whom you wish to engage in a video call. This identifier is often referred to as a \"contact\" or \"phone number\". Utilize the computer's keyboard to type in the destination identifier, being cautious of any typos or errors.\n\n5. Establish Connection: After entering the desired destination, click on the button that says \"call\" or \"video call\" which is usually located near the original button that initiated the communication portal. This will send a digital signal requesting a connection to the designated recipient.\n\n6. Await Response: At this stage, it is crucial to exercise patience as the digital signal makes its way to the intended recipient. They must also adhere to similar overcomplicated instructions to accept your video call. Once they do, the application will notify you via visual and auditory cues, indicating that the connection has been established.\n\n7. Optimize Visual and Auditory Experience: While engaged in the video call, ensure that both parties are visible and audible by adjusting the settings within the application. This may involve selecting the appropriate input and output devices, such as microphones and speakers, and tweaking the resolution and frame rate of the video stream to optimize the experience.\n\n8. Engage in Conversation: With the video call now operational, you may proceed to engage in a verbal and visual conversation with the other party. Be mindful of social etiquette and maintain a polite demeanor throughout the interaction.\n\n9. Terminate the Call: When the video call has concluded, click on the button within the application that says \"end call\" or \"hang up\", which is usually depicted as a phone with a red circle and a line through it. This will terminate the connection and return you to the computer's main interface.\n\n10. Post-Call Maintenance: Finally, ensure that your computing apparatus returns to its initial state by closing the video call application. This can be achieved by clicking on the application's icon within the computer's interface and selecting the option to close the program. Your computing device will then be ready for the next overcomplicated task or video call.\n"}
