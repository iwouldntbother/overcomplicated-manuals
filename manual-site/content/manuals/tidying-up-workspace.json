Commence by designating a specific temporal segment within the confines of the solar day, which shall be dedicated to this intricate procedure.\n   b. Prior to the onset of the temporal segment, activate the device known as a \"smartphone\" and select an application that generates random words, which shall serve as your personalized 'tidying up' code-name.\n   c. Procure a quantity of three unicorn-themed sticky notes, each with a distinct hue, and apply them to the workspace surface to designate the three primary zones: \"magical unicorn dust storage\", \"enchanted book sorting\", and \"mythical trinket display\".\n\n2. Magical Unicorn Dust Storage Zone:\n\n   a. Don a pair of protective eyewear and gloves, ensuring that they are certified by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).\n   b. Utilize a device known as a \"vacuum cleaner\" to remove any and all potential \"magical unicorn dust\" particles that may have accumulated in the vicinity.\n   c. Carefully examine each item within the designated zone and determine if it contains any traces of \"magical unicorn dust\". If it does, transfer it to a labeled container with the aforementioned tidying up code-name.\n   d. If an item does not contain \"magical unicorn dust\", proceed to the \"enchanted book sorting\" zone.\n\n3. Enchanted Book Sorting Zone:\n\n   a. Deploy a device called a \"bookmark\", which shall serve as a guide for navigating through each tome in the zone.\n   b. Employ a technique known as the \"alphabetical sorting ritual\", which involves arranging books in alphabetical order based on the author's last name.\n   c. If a book is found to be incomplete, or lacking in \"enchantment\", transfer it to a designated \"rehoming pile\" for subsequent donation or disposal.\n   d. If a book is deemed enchanting, proceed to the \"mythical trinket display\" zone.\n\n4. Mythical Trinket Display Zone:\n\n   a. Engage in a ritual known as the \"trinket arrangement ceremony\", which involves arranging the trinkets according to their size, shape, and mythical origin.\n   b. If a trinket is found to be non-mythical or uninteresting, transfer it to the previously designated \"rehoming pile\".\n   c. If a trinket is deemed mythical and interesting, it shall be granted a place of honor in the \"mythical trinket display\".\n\n5. Final Phase: The Rehoming Pile:\n\n   a. If any items remain in the \"rehoming pile\", deploy a device called a \"vehicle\" to transport these items to a designated location for donation or disposal.\n   b. Perform a ritual known as the \"thank you offering\", which involves donating a small sum of currency to a nearby charity as a token of gratitude for the tidying up process.\n   c. Congratulations! The workspace has now been tidied up in a most overcomplicated manner.\n\nRemember, it is of utmost importance that each step is followed precisely, lest the workspace remain in a state of disarray and potential danger.\n"}
