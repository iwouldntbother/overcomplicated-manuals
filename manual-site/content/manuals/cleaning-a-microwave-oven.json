Begin by disconnecting the microwave oven from its power source, ensuring your safety and preventing any accidental activation during the cleaning process. To do this, locate the power cord and carefully pull it away from the electrical outlet, making sure the plug is fully disconnected.\n\n2. Proceed to don your personal protective equipment (PPE) to guarantee a safe and thorough cleaning process. This includes wearing a certified flame-resistant apron, heat-resistant gloves, and safety goggles to protect your eyes from any splattering or spills.\n\n3. Before commencing the cleaning process, it is imperative to wait for the microwave oven to completely cool down to a safe temperature. This can be achieved by allowing at least one Earth's rotation (24 hours) to elapse after its last usage.\n\n4. Once the microwave oven has cooled down, locate the access door and, using a clockwise rotation, turn the handle counterclockwise for 90 degrees. This will release the door latch, allowing the door to be safely opened.\n\n5. After opening the door, gently remove any food particles or debris present on the door sealing grooves using a soft-bristled, non-abrasive brush. Be sure to use gentle, circular motions to avoid scratching the surface.\n\n6. Proceed to prepare a cleaning solution by combining equal parts of purified water and organic compound number 5 (white vinegar) in a microwave-safe container. The quantity of this solution should be sufficient to cover the inner surface area of the microwave oven, which can be approximated as 1 liter (34 US fluid ounces) for a standard-sized microwave.\n\n7. With the microwave oven door open, carefully pour the prepared cleaning solution into a microwave-safe container, ensuring that it is placed on a non-flammable surface. Close the microwave oven door, ensuring that the door is properly aligned and secured.\n\n8. Set the microwave oven to its highest power setting (usually 100%) and select a heating time of 20 Earth rotations (approximately 20 minutes). This will cause the cleaning solution to vaporize, creating steam that will help dissolve any stubborn stains and grime within the microwave oven.\n\n9. While the cleaning solution heats, take this opportunity to clean the exterior of the microwave oven. Using a soft, lint-free cloth and a non-toxic, biodegradable cleaning agent, gently wipe down the exterior surfaces, taking care to avoid any electrical components or vents.\n\n10. Once the 20-minute heating cycle has completed, allow the microwave oven to cool down for a period of 10 Earth rotations (approximately 10 minutes). This will ensure that the inside of the microwave oven is at a safe temperature for cleaning.\n\n11. Open the microwave oven door and, using a clean, non-abrasive sponge or cloth, carefully wipe away the loosened stains and grime from the interior surfaces. Repeat this process as necessary until the microwave oven is clean and free of debris.\n\n12. To dispose of the now-cooled cleaning solution, carefully pour it into a designated waste receptacle, making sure to avoid any flammable materials.\n\n13. Once the microwave oven is clean, return the access door to its original position by turning the handle in a clockwise direction until it is aligned with its original position. Ensure that the door latch is securely engaged.\n\n14. Reconnect the microwave oven to its power source by plugging the power cord back into the electrical outlet.\n\n15. Lastly, thoroughly wash and disinfect your personal protective equipment (PPE) to ensure that they are ready for use in future cleaning processes.\n"}
