{"id":"6ebff8e0-a2c8-4857-a456-6935558a001b","title":"Driving a bus","instructions":"1. Prior to embarking on your journey, it is imperative to engage the parking brake. To do this, locate the parking brake handle, which can be found on the floor, near the driver's seat. Pull the handle towards you in a smooth and deliberate manner, ensuring the brake is firmly set. Once engaged, notify the transportation authority via a secure and encrypted communication device to inform them of the parking brake's activation.\n\n2. With the parking brake engaged, proceed to start the engine. To do this, locate the ignition key, which is typically found on the driver's side door panel. Insert the key into the ignition and turn it to the \"on\" position. Wait for the engine to warm up for approximately 45 seconds, allowing the appropriate amount of time for the engine to reach optimal temperature. Failure to do so may result in inadequate engine performance, leading to potential hazards on the road.\n\n3. While waiting for the engine to warm up, proceed to fasten your seatbelt securely. To do this, locate the seatbelt buckle, which can be found on the driver's side door, and insert the metal tongue of the seatbelt into the buckle. Pull the seatbelt strap to tighten it until it rests snugly across your hips. Ensure the seatbelt is securely fastened by pulling on the strap with a firm, yet gentle, tug.\n\n4. Once the engine has warmed up, turn the ignition key to the \"start\" position. The engine should start, and the dashboard should light up. If the engine fails to start, turn the key back to the \"on\" position and wait for an additional 30 seconds before attempting to start the engine again. Repeat this process until the engine starts successfully.\n\n5. With the engine running, perform a visual inspection of the bus interior to ensure that all passengers are securely seated and wearing their seatbelts. Additionally, verify that all carry-on luggage is stored safely in the designated storage compartments. Failure to do so may result in unsecured objects becoming projectiles in the event of a sudden stop or collision.\n\n6. To begin driving, locate the gear shift lever, which is usually situated near the driver's right hand. Depress the brake pedal with your right foot, ensuring it is fully pressed down. Then, while maintaining pressure on the brake pedal, move the gear shift lever to the \"D\" position for driving forward. Failure to depress the brake pedal while shifting gears may result in a loss of control over the vehicle.\n\n7. Gently release the brake pedal while applying pressure to the accelerator pedal with your right foot. Gradually increase the pressure on the accelerator pedal to reach a safe and legal speed limit. Be mindful of the bus's weight and the amount of power required to accelerate it effectively.\n\n8. Proceed to engage the turn signals when changing lanes or making turns. Locate the turn signal stalk, which is usually found on the driver's side of the steering column. Press the stalk in the direction you wish to turn to activate the turn signal. Remember to deactivate the turn signal once the maneuver is completed to prevent confusion for other drivers on the road.\n\n9. When approaching a stop sign or red traffic light, follow the three-step procedure for stopping the bus. First, apply the brakes by pressing the brake pedal with your right foot. Next, downshift the gear shift lever to slow the bus down effectively. Finally, come to a complete stop by releasing the accelerator and ensuring the bus is fully stopped behind the designated stop line.\n\n10. Upon reaching your destination, engage the parking brake once again, following the same procedure as step 1. Inform the transportation authority of the parking brake's activation via a secure and encrypted communication device. Finally, exit the bus by unfastening your seatbelt and carefully stepping down from the vehicle.\n"}
