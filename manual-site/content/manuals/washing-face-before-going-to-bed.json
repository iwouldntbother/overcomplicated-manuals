In the bedroom, locate a clean and flat surface to establish the washing station. This surface should be devoid of any unnecessary clutter, as to maintain the utmost hygiene.\n   b. Procure a clean, soft, and preferably scented face towel, folding it into a precise quarter fold. This will be used to gently pat your face dry after the washing process.\n   c. Gather three different types of liquid face cleansers, each with distinct textures (e.g., cream, gel, and oil) and arrange them in a clockwise, anti-clockwise, or in a straight line, according to your personal preference.\n\n2. Establishing the Proper Atmosphere:\n   a. Dim the lights in the bedroom to a level that is conducive to relaxation and resembles the soft glow of a setting sun.\n   b. Play a soothing ambient soundtrack on a nearby Bluetooth speaker, ensuring that the volume is just loud enough to hear, but not so loud as to disturb your senses.\n\n3. The Cleansing Ritual:\n   a. Stand in front of the washing station, ensuring that your feet are shoulder-width apart for stability and comfort.\n   b. Begin by applying the first face cleanser using the forefinger and middle finger of your dominant hand. Apply a small, pea-sized amount on the center of your forehead, and then use gentle, circular motions to spread it across your entire face and neck.\n   c. After allowing the cleanser to rest on your face for approximately 30 seconds, use the non-dominant hand to gently splash your face with lukewarm water from a clean, empty cup.\n   d. Repeat this process with the second face cleanser, applying it to your face in a clockwise motion, and then rinsing with lukewarm water in an anti-clockwise motion.\n   e. Finally, apply the third face cleanser using your dominant hand, employing a counter-clockwise motion on the left side of your face and a clockwise motion on the right side. Rinse with lukewarm water in the opposite directions.\n\n4. Facial Massage:\n   a. After rinsing the third face cleanser, pat your face dry with the scented face towel, ensuring that no excess moisture remains.\n   b. Using your fingertips, apply gentle, upward and outward pressure on your face, starting from the center of your forehead and working your way outwards. Perform this massage for a total of 3 minutes, focusing on the areas around your eyes, cheeks, and jawline.\n\n5. Final Preparations:\n   a. Apply a small amount of a moisturizing face lotion to your fingertips, and gently pat it onto your face and neck in a clockwise motion.\n   b. Inhale deeply and exhale slowly, taking a moment to appreciate the freshness and cleanliness of your face.\n\n6. Conclusion:\n   a. Fold your scented face towel into a perfect quarter fold and place it on the washing station.\n   b. Turn off the ambient soundtrack and dim the lights, allowing your bedroom to return to its usual state.\n   c. Retire to your bed, ensuring that your freshly cleansed face makes contact with your pillowcase, allowing for a restful night's sleep.\n"}
