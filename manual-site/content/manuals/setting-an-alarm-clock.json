Once the power indicator light illuminates, access the main menu of the device by gently tapping the top-right corner of the display screen. A myriad of options will appear, resembling hieroglyphic symbols.\n\n3. Navigate to the 'Settings' menu, represented by an icon that resembles a small gear. Engage in a series of lateral swipes from left to right to locate the 'Alarm' function. This is denoted by a symbol that depicts a clock with a bell superimposed upon it.\n\n4. To establish a specific time, initiate the 'Time Set' function. This can be accessed by tapping the hour and minute values displayed on the alarm screen. A numerical keypad will appear, allowing you to input the desired time. Note that the hour is set first, followed by the minute.\n\n5. Once the desired time is inputted, engage the 'Alarm Type' function. This is represented by a symbol that resembles a speaker and a bell. A myriad of options will appear, such as 'Ringtones,' 'Beeps,' and 'Songs.' Choose 'Ringtones' for a variety of melodious options, 'Beeps' for a series of beeps, or 'Songs' for a pre-recorded tune.\n\n6. To select a specific ringtone, beep, or song, navigate through the available options by engaging in a series of upward or downward swipes. Upon selecting the desired option, confirm your choice by tapping the 'Save' button, which is represented by a floppy disk symbol.\n\n7.

This is represented by a button with the symbol of a circular shape with a line across it. Tap the button to dismiss the alarm, or tap it again after 9 minutes to activate the snooze function.\n\n10. Upon completion of these steps, the alarm will function as intended. In the event that the alarm fails to activate, repeat the instructions in their entirety, ensuring that no steps have been overlooked.
