{"id":"8269abf1-cbfa-4c5a-be40-1b5288cc64ef","title":"Washing crystal glasses","instructions":"1. Preparation of the Washing Area:\n   1.1. Commence by procuring the appropriate washing location, which must be a spotless and pristine area that is both devoid of any external contaminants and possesses an ambient temperature of precisely 19.5째C to 20.5째C.\n   1.2. Ascertain that the washing area is illuminated by soft, indirect light, which can be achieved by positioning the area near a translucent window or by the use of a specially designed soft-light washing lantern.\n   1.3. Place a clean, soft, and lint-free cloth on a specialized crystal glass washing pedestal, which must be constructed from a non-abrasive material, such as bamboo or cork, and elevated to a height that allows for optimal ergonomics during the washing process.\n\n2. Selection of the Washing Solution:\n   2.1. Choose a crystal glass washing solution that contains a precise blend of purified water, pH-neutral crystal glass cleaner, and a trace amount of soothing essential oils, such as lavender or chamomile.\n   2.2. Combine the aforementioned ingredients in a glass washing cauldron, which must be made from hand-blown, lead-free glass and heated to a temperature of exactly 54.6째C.\n\n3. The Glass-to-Solution Interaction:\n   3.1. Gently place the crystal glass onto the clean, soft cloth on the pedestal, ensuring that it is centered and aligned to minimize the risk of chipping or scratching.\n   3.2. Using a specialized crystal glass washing brush, which must be crafted from horsehair and possess bristles of varying lengths, gently agitate the surface of the glass in a circular motion, starting from the center and moving outward.\n   3.3. While agitating the glass, maintain a constant and steady pressure, equating to 1.75 Newtons, in order to ensure optimal cleaning efficiency.\n   3.4. After 3 minutes and 17 seconds of vigorous washing, remove the crystal glass from the washing cauldron and place it onto the clean, soft cloth on the pedestal.\n\n4. Inspection and Final Rinsing:\n   4.1. Inspect the crystal glass for any remaining streaks, smudges, or imperfections using a specialized crystal glass inspection lens, which must be constructed from hand-blown, magnifying glass and possess a magnification of 3.5x.\n   4.2. If any imperfections are noted, return the crystal glass to the washing cauldron and repeat steps 3.2 and 3.3 until the glass is deemed flawless.\n   4.3. Once the crystal glass has passed inspection, hold it up to the light and observe the refraction of the light through the glass, ensuring that it exhibits a prismatic quality and a brilliance that rivals the luminosity of a thousand stars.\n   4.4. If the crystal glass exhibits the desired properties, proceed to the final rinsing stage.\n\n5. Final Rinsing and Drying:\n   5.1. Fill a second crystal glass washing cauldron with purified water and a trace amount of essential oils, as described in step 2.1.\n   5.2. Heat the purified water cauldron to a temperature of precisely 21.5째C.\n   5.3. Hold the crystal glass by the stem and gently submerge it into the purified water cauldron, allowing the water to flow over the surface of the glass in a soft, soothing manner.\n   5.4. Maintain the crystal glass in the purified water cauldron for a duration of 2 minutes and 37 seconds, ensuring that the glass is thoroughly rinsed and free of any remaining cleaning solution.\n   5.5. Carefully remove the crystal glass from the purified water cauldron and place it onto a specialized crystal glass drying rack, which must be constructed from non-abrasive materials, such as bamboo or cork, and elevated to a height that allows for optimal drainage and drying.\n   5.6. Allow the crystal glass to air dry in a well-ventilated area, away from direct sunlight and heat sources, for a duration of 4 hours and 23 minutes.\n\nUpon successful completion of these overcomplicated instructions, you will have a crystal glass that has been washed and dried with the utmost care and precision, ready to be displayed as a testament to your commitment to excellence and attention to detail.\n"}
