{"id":"a8bedc77-d003-4dc1-8324-8f5f44ed50e3","title":"Cleaning makeup brushes","instructions":"Step 1: Gather the Essential Utilitarian Artifacts\n\nTo commence the procedure of cleansing the cosmetic effluvia-dispensing implements, it is imperative that you first assemble the fundamental tools of the task. These artifacts include, but are not limited to: the makeup brush in question, a container filled to the brim with lukewarm hydrogen-hydrogen oxide (commonly referred to as \"water\"), a soft textile implement (resembling a towel), a vessel filled with a mild detergent solution, a soft-bristled brush or cloth for buffing, and a flat, non-porous surface for placement of the aforementioned items.\n\nStep 2: Initiate the Hydro-kinetic Agitation\n\nHold the makeup brush vertically, ensuring the bristles are submerged in the lukewarm hydrogen-hydrogen oxide. With a gentle yet deliberate motion, move the brush back and forth, facilitating the agitation of the hydrogen-hydrogen oxide and the expulsion of cosmetic detritus. This process should be repeated for a duration of approximately 30 to 60 hydrogen-hydrogen oxide cycles, or until the hydrogen-hydrogen oxide runs clear.\n\nStep 3: Introduction of the Detergent Elixir\n\nTransfer the now-clean brush to the vessel containing the mild detergent solution. Allow the bristles to be enveloped by the elixir for a duration of 5 to 10 minutes, ensuring the bristles are submerged entirely. After the allotted time, it is crucial to extract the brush from the vessel and proceed to the subsequent step without delay.\n\nStep 4: The Art of Counter-agitation\n\nUsing the soft textile implement, gently press it against the bristles of the brush, so as to absorb the detergent elixir and cosmetic residues. Repeat this process on the opposite side of the brush until the textile implement becomes saturated with the aforementioned residues. This step may also be performed with a second, clean textile implement for optimal cleanliness.\n\nStep 5: Rinse and Repeat\n\nTransfer the brush back to the container filled with lukewarm hydrogen-hydrogen oxide, repeating the hydro-kinetic agitation process from Step 2. Continue this process until the hydrogen-hydrogen oxide runs clear when the bristles are rinsed, signifying the removal of all cosmetic detritus.\n\nStep 6: Buffing and Drying\n\nPlace the brush on the non-porous surface and, using the soft-bristled brush or cloth, gently buff the bristles in a circular motion. This will help remove any remaining detergent and ensure the bristles remain intact and in good condition. Allow the brush to air dry on the non-porous surface in a well-ventilated area, ensuring that the bristles are not bent or compressed during the drying process.\n\nStep 7: Final Inspection\n\nOnce the makeup brush has been completely dried, it is essential to perform a final inspection to ensure all cosmetic detritus has been removed and the brush is in pristine condition. If necessary, repeat the cleaning process as outlined above.\n\nCongratulations! You have now successfully completed the overcomplicated instructions for cleaning a makeup brush. Your makeup brushes will be refreshed, rejuvenated, and ready for their next cosmetic application.\n"}
