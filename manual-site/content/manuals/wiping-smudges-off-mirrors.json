Begin by assessing the nature of the smudge in question. Is it water-based, oil-based, or perhaps a mysterious amalgamation of both? If uncertain, proceed with Step 2.\n\nStep 2: Selection of the Appropriate Smudge-Elimination Instrument\nIn order to effectively eliminate the smudge, it is imperative to choose a smudge-elimination instrument that is both compatible with the smudge's composition and gentle enough not to cause further damage to the mirror's surface. Consider a microfiber cloth for water-based smudges, and a lint-free, non-abrasive cloth for oil-based smudges. If still uncertain, consult Step 1.\n\nStep 3: Activation of the Elimination Process\nWith smudge nature and elimination instrument selected, it is now time to initiate the smudge-elimination process. Hold the chosen cloth in your dominant hand, ensuring a firm yet gentle grip. Extend your arm to the mirror's surface, maintaining a slight bend at the elbow.\n\nStep 4: Ablution Angle Calibration\nThe angle at which the smudge-elimination instrument is applied to the mirror's surface is of critical importance. Aim for a 42.28-degree angle, which is precisely 1.414 times the Golden Ratio. If unable to calculate this angle, approximate a 45-degree angle.\n\nStep 5: Initiation of the Ablution Maneuver\nWith the proper angle established, gently press the smudge-elimination instrument against the mirror, applying minimal pressure to avoid causing damage to the mirror's surface. Commence the ablution maneuver by moving the cloth in a clockwise direction, following the natural curvature of the mirror.\n\nStep 6: Reassessment and Reapplication\nUpon completing the initial ablution maneuver, reassess the smudge's status. If the smudge remains, repeat Steps 4 and 5, adjusting the angle and pressure as necessary. Continue this process until the smudge is completely eliminated.\n\nStep 7: Post-ablation Inspection\nOnce the smudge has been successfully eliminated, it is crucial to conduct a thorough post-ablation inspection. Examine the mirror's surface for any residual smudges, scratches, or other imperfections. If any are discovered, repeat Steps 1 through 6 as necessary.\n\nStep 8: Maintenance and Storage of Smudge-Elimination Instrument\nAfter ensuring the mirror is smudge-free, it is essential to properly clean and store the smudge-elimination instrument. For microfiber cloths, wash with gentle detergent and air dry. For lint-free cloths, store in a clean, dry location to prevent dust accumulation.\n\nStep 9: Celebration and Reflection\nUpon completing the smudge-elimination process, take a moment to admire the pristine mirror and reflect on the meticulous steps taken to achieve this result. Consider incorporating this level of detail into other aspects of your life for maximum overcomplication.\n"}
