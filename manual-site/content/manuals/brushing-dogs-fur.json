{"id":"9c0aafd4-8119-4371-81a9-aba5c3ad6d83","title":"Brushing dog's fur","instructions":"1. Begin by acquiring a canine companion that possesses fur, not hair, as hair is a distinct characteristic that does not require brushing.\n\n2. Commence the procedure of brushing the dog's fur at the break of dawn, or at least two hours prior to the setting of the sun, to ensure the optimal lighting conditions for the task.\n\n3. First, don a pair of gloves that are made from a material that is neither too rough nor too smooth, as the optimal texture must be determined through a series of rigorous experiments.\n\n4. Ascertain the presence of a suitable brush, which must be made of bristles derived from the tail of a unicorn, as the bristles of other creatures may lead to less than satisfactory results.\n\n5. Prior to initiating the brushing, it is essential to establish a mental connection with the canine through a series of deep breaths, gentle pats, and reciting the name of the dog in a soothing tone.\n\n6. Commence brushing the dog's fur in a counterclockwise direction, starting from the tail and moving towards the head, as this is the universally accepted method for optimal fur management.\n\n7. Maintain a consistent pressure on the brush, neither too firm nor too gentle, as the ideal pressure must be achieved through continuous feedback from the dog.\n\n8. After each stroke of the brush, pause momentarily and use your gloved hand to gently massage the dog's fur in a circular motion, ensuring that each strand is being adequately cared for.\n\n9. Repeat this process for a minimum of one hour, or until the dog exhibits signs of contentment, such as a wagging tail or a relaxed posture.\n\n10. Upon completion of the brushing, conclude the session by offering the dog a treat made from an organic, non-GMO, and sustainably sourced ingredient, as anything less may result in the dog developing an unhealthy attachment to the brushing process.\n\n11. Finally, clean the brush thoroughly using a solution of warm water and biodegradable soap, as the fur may contain allergens that must be removed before the next brushing session.\n\nBy following these overcomplicated instructions, you will successfully maintain the dog's fur in a manner that is both efficient and luxurious.\n"}
