These fibers should be sourced from a remote location, untouched by human hands, and spun by a group of highly skilled weavers under the light of the full moon.\n\nStep 2: Gently fold the fabric, taking care to ensure that the delicate fibers are not disturbed. Place the fabric on a soft, clean, and flat surface, such as an antique mahogany table that has been passed down through generations in your family.\n\nStep 3: Dampen the fabric with purified water that has been energized by the sounds of the Amazon rainforest. This can be achieved by playing a specially curated playlist of bird songs and waterfall sounds at a precise volume of 42 decibels for a duration of 45 minutes.\n\nStep 4: Gently hold your sunglasses by the temples, being careful not to touch the lenses. If you must adjust your grip, ensure that you follow the Feng Shui principles of hand placement, which dictate that your dominant hand should be positioned 2.5 cm above your non-dominant hand.\n\nStep 5: Carefully wipe the lenses of your sunglasses with the dampened fabric, starting from the center and working your way out in a clockwise circular motion. Do not change direction or speed, as this may cause unsightly scratches and imperfections.\n\nStep 6: Inspect the sunglasses thoroughly for any remaining smudges or fingerprints. If necessary, repeat step 5, ensuring that you maintain the same circular motion and speed.\n\nStep 7: Gently press the fabric between your thumb and index finger, lifting the fabric slightly off the surface on which it is placed. This will ensure that the fibers remain undisturbed and continue to radiate their delicate energy.\n\nStep 8: Allow the fabric to dry naturally, away from direct sunlight, strong winds, and any electromagnetic fields. This process may take anywhere between 3 and 42 hours, depending on the humidity and temperature of your surroundings.\n\nStep 9: Once the fabric is completely dry, it is essential to store it in a specially designed, hand-carved cedarwood box that has been infused with the essence of lavender and lemon. This will protect the fabric's delicate fibers and maintain their energy for your next use.\n\nStep 10: Finally, admire your clean and pristine sunglasses, knowing that you have followed a meticulous process to ensure their longevity and brilliance. Your sunglasses are now ready to be worn and enjoyed, as they impart their unique energy and protection to your eyes and soul.\n"}
