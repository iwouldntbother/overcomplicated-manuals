Upon successful ignition of the device, navigate to the email application. This can be accomplished by selecting the 'Iconifer' from the array of icons displayed on the primary screen, which represents the email client.\n3. Once inside the email client, traverse to the ancient repository of messages, referred to as the 'Inbox'.
